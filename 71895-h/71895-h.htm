<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>In every field of human endeavor, he that is first must perpetually live
in the white light of publicity. ¶Whether the leadership be vested
in a man or in a manufactured product, emulation and envy are ever at
work. ¶In art, in literature, in music, in industry, the reward and the
punishment are always the same. ¶The reward is widespread recognition;
the punishment, fierce denial and detraction. ¶When a man’s
work becomes a standard for the whole world, it also becomes a target
for the shafts of the envious few. ¶If his work be merely mediocre, he
will be left severely alone—if he achieve a masterpiece, it will set a million
tongues a wagging. ¶Jealousy does not protrude its forked tongue at
the artist who produces a commonplace painting. ¶Whatsoever you
write, or paint, or play, or sing, or build, no one will strive to surpass or
to slander you, unless your work be stamped with the seal of genius.
¶Long, long, after a great work, or a good work has been done, those who
are disappointed or envious, continue to cry out that it can not be done.
¶Spiteful little voices in the domain of art were raised against our own
Whistler as a mountebank, long after the big world had acclaimed him
its greatest artistic genius. ¶Multitudes flocked to Bayreuth to worship
at the musical shrine of Wagner, while the little group of those whom he
had dethroned and displaced, argued angrily that he was no musician at
all. ¶The little world continued to protest that Fulton could never
build a steamboat, while the big world flocked to the river banks to see
his boat steam by. ¶The leader is assailed because he is a leader, and
the effort to equal him is merely added proof of that leadership. ¶Failing
to equal or to excel, the follower seeks to depreciate and to destroy—but
only confirms once more the superiority of that which he strives to
supplant. ¶There is nothing new in this. ¶It is as old as the world
and as old as the human passions—envy, fear, greed, ambition, and the
desire to surpass. ¶And it all avails nothing. ¶If the leader truly
leads, he remains—the leader. ¶Master-poet, master-painter, master-workman,
each in his turn is assailed, and each holds his laurels through
the ages. ¶That which is good or great makes itself known, no matter
how loud the clamor of denial. ¶That which deserves to live—lives.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>WORLD COMMENT</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>THE UNITED STATES NOT A “TENDERFOOT”</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>In the old days when the “bad man”
flourished on our western frontier the
gunmen would occasionally suspend
their slaughter of each other to have fun
with a “tenderfoot.” An inoffensive
easterner landing from the stage would be
surrounded by a crowd and would
suddenly receive from some one in the
crowd an order to dance. If he remonstrated
or failed to comply instantly
with the demand, a revolver bullet would
strike close to his feet, the order would be
reiterated, and the poor fellow would be
compelled to lift his feet and gyrate to the
crash of bullets from a “45” in the hands
of a noted desperado, until he was exhausted.</p>

<p class='c008'>It begins to look as if some of the
belligerent powers of Europe would like to
make us dance to the crash of diplomatic
notes and unjustifiable war measures. In
any street row it is usually the innocent
bystander that suffers most, and the
belligerents evidently don’t care how
much this neutral nation may suffer if
they can have their own way.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if we are not mistaken in our guess,
Uncle Sam will distinctively and decisively
decline to play the rôle of
“tenderfoot” for the amusement or
profit of European gunmen. The people
of this nation will insist upon full recognition
of their rights as neutrals—and not
only that, but on their privilege to carry
on their accustomed activities of travel,
trade and industry in accordance with the
universally recognized rules of international
law. In so far as the administration
at Washington insists upon the
assertion and exercise of these rights and
privileges, in so far will it be backed up by
the public sentiment of the nation. In so
far as it falls short of maintaining the full
height of the dignity of American manhood,
in so far will it fall short of its duty
and the demands of our intelligent and
responsible citizenship.</p>

<p class='c008'>The people of this country do not want
war with any of the belligerent nations,
nor do they expect that we will be drawn
into the war by the manly assertion of our
rights. But dreadful as war is, they would
prefer it to seeing our country and our flag
made a ridiculous spectacle of pusillanimity
and helplessness.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, no reasonable
citizen wants our government to be
bumptious and insulting, or to invite
reprisals by exceeding the measure of our
just demands. Nor is it likely that a firm
and reasonable attitude assumed by the
Washington administration will draw us
into the war. It is not at all probable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that any of the great powers arrayed
against each other on European battle
fields or the high seas want war with the
United States now. On the contrary, any
one of them would undoubtedly make
sacrifices to avoid it. We do not, however,
ask of any of them any sacrifice
beyond the observance of the recognized
rules of international law and the dictates
of humanity. If any nation would declare
war against us because we call a halt upon
its savagery so far as our own citizens are
concerned, we could fight with a good conscience
and with a confident trust in the
God of justice and mercy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The United States is not called upon to
go to war to protect any of the nations of
the Eastern Hemisphere, or the rights and
immunities of their citizens. We are not
called upon to take sides in the conflict
now raging; but we are called upon to protect
our own citizens in their lives, their
immunities and their world-rights, and if
we fall below the measure of this duty
history will judge us as a pitiful and decadent
race.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>MUTUAL OBLIGATION</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The obligation of our foreign-born
naturalized citizens and of our
government is mutual. The naturalized
citizens owe loyalty to the United
States and the United States owes them
protection. The foreigner, taking out his
citizenship papers, forswears allegiance to
the country of his birth and specifically to
the ruler or rulers thereof, and swears to
be a true and faithful citizen to the country
of his adoption. With this oath upon his
soul, any divided allegiance upon his part
is treasonable. Politically he stands
precisely upon the basis of a native-born
citizen. So do his children, whether born
in this country or not. His minor
children, born abroad, if they have come
to the United States with him, become
citizens through his naturalization.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the naturalized citizens thus
owe the same undivided allegiance to the
country of their adoption that her native
citizens owe, the country of their adoption
owes them precisely the same protection
that it owes the native-born. It owes
them and their families the same protection
of the laws, the same opportunities
for a vocation, the same right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Our
government also owes them the same protection
while traveling or temporarily sojourning
in foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having exacted from the naturalized
citizen the forswearing of his allegiance to
the country of his former domicile and its
rulers, the United States perhaps owes
even a more punctilious obligation to him
to protect him in his rights of American
citizenship. For if the native country of
the naturalized citizen does not recognize
his right of expatriation, and insists upon
holding him, for instance, to military
service, the United States should be ready
and able to protect him in his right of exemption
from such service. A country
that cannot protect its own citizens,
whether native or naturalized, has no
right to independent existence. In these
times the bearing of this point upon the
physical power of this government to
assert itself and to command respectful
attention to its just demands, needs no
extended discussion. It is a time when no
virile nation can afford to leave itself
denuded of defensive power and helpless.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE AFTERMATH</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The United States cannot satisfy all
the people of the belligerent countries
by its neutrality. The people
of Europe are so wrought up by the present
deplorable conditions that most of them
have come to believe that all who are not
for them are against them. There is irritation
both on the part of the Teutonic
allies and the Anglo-French allies because
our government has not shown more decided
sympathies with one side or the other,
and taken a more decisive stand for or
against the conflicting contentions. When
the war ends there will doubtless be anger
against us in all the belligerent countries.
Should the war end in anything like a
draw, leaving one or more great nations
with a veteran and still formidable army
and navy, such an army and navy would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>be more than a match for any force that
the United States now has in being.
Should one of the nations, thus relieved
from peril on its own continent, see fit to
call this country to account for some
fancied failure in neutral obligation, or to
demand from us a large indemnity, the
countries formerly at war with it might
not see fit to make any intervention in our
behalf. They might all say to Uncle
Samuel: “You left us to fight our own
battles and were not moved to interfere
even by the dictates of humanity. Now
we will leave you to fight yours!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is useless to say that at the end of the
war all the countries, and notably
England and Germany, will be so exhausted
that they will be unable to engage
in another great war. History does not
so teach. At the end of a long war a
country has its forces mobilized and
equipped and the military spirit at its
height. At the close of our four years’ exhausting
Civil War, the United States was
the most formidable military power in the
world, which it is very far from being to-day.
It is no time for our people to
imitate the ostrich and hide their heads in
the sand. There are perils ahead for us
whether the war ends soon or late, and
however it ends. And besides that, if we
desire to promote the world’s peace, we
must be prepared to speak with a strong
voice. Idealistic notions are valuable in
their place, but they are about as potent
in the storm of war, and the aftermath of
a great world-war, as the twittering of
sparrows in a storm. If our country lies
helpless it will simply be a temptation to
some of the now warring nations to recoup
themselves from our wealth for their
enormous losses.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>GERMANY’S MATERIAL ADVANTAGE</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Germany enjoys one material
advantage in this war, aside from
her superior organization, that
has so far proved a potent factor in enabling
her to maintain her position on all
the battle fronts. Germany’s normal output
of iron and coal is twice that of the
British Isles. In addition Germany has,
since the early days of the war, controlled
the large iron and coal product of
Belgium, and four-fifths that of France. It
is difficult to exaggerate the importance
of iron and coal and iron and coal
products in creating and operating the
machinery of war. Besides this command
of war material, Germany has better
command of labor to work the material
into war munitions. We do not hear of
any labor strikes in Germany. Industrial
Germany is as much a unit as military
Germany. Of the allies, the British
people do not seem to realize what a
terrible antagonist they have in Germany.
We still hear of British political dissentions
and British labor troubles. If
the allies expect to win, if the Great
Britain expects to preserve the British
Empire or even to save the British Isles
from invasion and German occupation,
then British people will have to drop their
internal dissensions, summons all their
resources, and fight and work as one man
for self-preservation.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE WILL TO PEACE</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>In this world-crisis the American
people need to search their hearts and
determine whether their ideals of
peace are based on softness, effeminacy,
disinclination to exertion and sacrifice, love
of ease and pleasure, or upon absolute principle.
In either case, we must arouse ourselves
and cast off sloth. Peace is not to be
had except with righteousness. The will to
peace must be buttressed in strength, and
not in weakness. In the present temper
of the world, international friendship
doesn’t seem to count. The nations have
lapsed into sheer materialism. Each one
is seeking its own aims and interests.
Such alliances as exist are made because
each member of the alliance believes that
its interests will be better served by that
combination than by any other. Every
one of the lesser states of Europe not
already engaged in the war is striving
anxiously to determine on which side its
bread is buttered—that is whether continued
neutrality or active participation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>on one side or the other will best serve its
turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>The proper policy of the United States
is neutrality, but we will gain nothing by
toadying to one belligerent or another.
Our treatment by the victor in the war, if
the war ends in victory for one side or the
other, will not be gauged by the friendship
we have displayed, or the disappointment
which our conduct has occasioned,
but by our strength or weakness. We
will have to rely upon our own resources
and not upon anybody’s favor. Our aim
as a nation should be, first to preserve our
standards of honor and independence.
We should truckle to no one. Next, to do
absolute justice and to uphold the standard
of humanity. We may not be able to
prevent any modification of international
law or changes in international rules of
warfare, in view of vastly changed conditions,
but we can insist upon the respect
due to us as a great nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The United States has a legitimate
“place in the sun,” and it must maintain
that place morally also physically if need
be. It is a time of human convulsion
when any display of weakness and
timidity will invite destruction.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>A SLANDER OF BRAVE MEN</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The story brought back from
Europe by Miss Jane Addams
about the “doping” of charging
soldiers, naturally amazes all who have
had any experience on the firing line.
She said in her speech at Carnegie Hall, on
July 9th, that in the present war, in order
to get soldiers to charge with the bayonet,
all nations are forced first to make the
men drunk. “In Germany,” she said,
“they have a regular formula for it. In
England they use rum, and the French
resort to absinthe. In other words, therefore,
in the terrible bayonet charges they
speak of with dread, the men must be
doped before they start.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This outgiving shows the folly of sending
an hysterical and credulous woman to
the front to get reliable information of war
conditions. It is quite probable that the
story was told to Miss Addams as she relates
it, but that a woman of her intelligence
should accept it as true and retail
it on her own authority is to be regretted.
It gives a misleading picture of
war conditions and is an insult to the best
manhood of all the nations engaged in the
war. Denials have come from all the
nations and friends of all the nations, but
these denials are hardly needed by those
who know about war.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever may be thought of the war,
and much as we may deplore its horrors
nobody can truthfully deny the courage
and hardihood of the men engaged in it,
whether they are Germans, English,
French or other nationals. It requires
just as much courage to endure the wearing
danger of the trenches as it does to
participate in a bayonet charge. In fact,
most soldiers would feel it as a relief to
substitute the excitement and activity of
an attack for the grinding peril of lying
still under fire. If the men would need to
be doped to get them to charge, they
would need to be constantly doped to
endure the sodden and bloody carnage of
the trenches.</p>

<p class='c008'>The work of war requires, more than
any other, physical and mental fitness as
well as resolution of soul. Every military
commander knows that strong liquor
would impair the physical strength and
endurance of men for the time being, if
not permanently. When a line of men
start upon a bayonet charge they need
every ounce of strength and endurance
they possess to give them any chance of
success. To send a line of doped men
upon a bayonet charge would be to invite
their almost certain destruction and the
failure of the movement. Even if commanders
were brutal enough to adopt the
dope tactics specified by Miss Addams
they would not be such fools.</p>

<p class='c008'>Richard Harding Davis, in commenting
on Miss Addams’s amazing “revelation,”
says: “I have seen more of this war and
other wars than Miss Addams, and against
this insult, flung by a complacent and
self-satisfied woman at men who gave
their lives for men, I protest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is enough material for genuine
and truthful indictment of war without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>resorting to silly falsehood. How would
the descendents of the men who gave up
their lives in our civil war from a sense of
imperious duty and patriotism like to
have the slander placed upon their graves
that the only way they could be induced
to go into battle was to stupify them with
intoxicants? Our war was a small one as
compared with this twentieth century
war, but it was just as perilous to the men
engaged in it as this is to the soldiers of the
present. An eminent military authority
recently published a statement to the
effect that in our civil war the casualties,
in proportion to the number of men engaged,
was ten times greater than the proportional
casualties now. We do not
know that this estimate is accurate, but
we do know that our casualties were proportionately
greater, in spite of the
superior effectiveness of the modern machinery
of war. The science of defense
has kept pace with the science of destruction.
Our war required just as much
courage and hardihood and endurance on
the part of the men engaged in it as this
war does, and we know that it was not
necessary to dope our men with strong
liquor, on either side, to get them to fight.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THOMAS A. EDISON DRAFTED</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The acceptance by Thomas A.
Edison of a position as the head of
an advisory defense board of
civilian inventors and engineers for a
bureau of invention and development
which the Navy Department is to create,
is an important step in the adoption of a
rational national policy. The submarine,
the airship and many other of the appliances
which have made modern war so
terrible and effective are of American
origin. American invention and ingenuity
have given the world the locomotive
engine, the steam boat, the magnetic
telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph,
the sewing machine, the reaper, the
harvester, the steam traction plow, the
automobile, and other appliances which
have changed the face of modern civilization.
American ingenuity has reigned
supreme alike in inventions of peace and
of war, but our country has not profited
to the full from the genius of our inventors.
Men of other nations have seized
upon American ideas and perfected them
to their own profit. This is notably the
case with the warlike appliances. The
European nations now at war have developed
the submarine and the aircraft to
the point of astonishing efficiency, while
the United States has lagged behind. In
case of war, our submarine and aircraft
service would, in its present condition of
development, be vastly inferior to that of
either Germany, England, or France.</p>

<p class='c008'>The United States either wants to be
prepared for war, or it does not. If it
does, it wants the best preparation. Mr.
Edison has been invited to head the
advisory board because of some views in
regard to national defenses expressed by
him several months ago. He stated at
that time that he would establish vast
reserve stores of arms and ammunition,
and would count rather upon automobiles
than upon the railroads for quick transportation.
He would also build many
aeroplanes and submarines, and would
keep our battleships and battle cruisers in
dry-dock—practically in storage—but
maintained in perfect efficiency, ready for
use in case they should be needed for
defense. He said he thought an army of
100,000 men, well trained men, backed by
an efficient militia, and ample stores of
munitions and weapons and other equipment,
would be sufficient, but he would
also have 40,000 drill sergeants selected
and trained to instruct quickly a vast
number of soldiers.</p>

<p class='c008'>This, it will be seen, is a purely defensive
military policy. Mr. Edison’s
ideas may be more or less valuable, but
his inventive genius and practical skill are
undoubted, and his presence on a board
composed of mechanical and scientific
experts will furnish an assurance that the
best methods to insure the nation’s safety
from hostile attack will be adopted.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c017'>Perseverance is more prevailing than violence
and many things which can not be overcome
when they are together yield themselves
up when taken little by little.</p>

  <h3 class='c015'>DR. DILLON ON THE FIRST PHASE OF THE WAR</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The following extract from an
article by Dr. E. J. Dillon in the
June number of the <cite>Contemporary
Review</cite> would seem to indicate that
England was at last deeply impressed with
the formidable character of her foe and the
terrible nature of the task before the
British people. Dr. Dillon says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The first phase of the world-conflict has
closed with the bitterness of exploded illusions,
the alarming growth of the spectre of destruction,
the quick materialization of the
danger that threatens the noblest possessions
of the human race, and the primary necessity
of unanimous sacrifices before that danger can
be displaced. Taking stock of the present
situation just as this war is about to enter its
second phase, we cannot but see that the
central fact which calls for recognition is the
amazing strength of the German nation.
After ten months of warfare against Russia,
Britain, France, Belgium and Serbia, it continues
not only to live its own life, drawing
from its own resources, but is able to send reinforcements
of all kinds to Turkey and Austria,
to achieve new conquests, plan grandiose
operations, and win noteworthy victories over
the allies.”</p>

<p class='c019'>If England had realized the actual and
potential strength of Germany from the
outset, and made her dispositions accordingly,
there might be a different story
to tell. France seems to have girded up
her loins from the start and to have
accomplished wonders with her comparatively
limited resources. Russia has
made a gallant fight under the handicap of
poor preparation and an immobile population.
This is a war in which masses do
not count against organized and trained
efficiency. Great Britain alone has had
the requisite resources and has failed to
utilize them to the point of the utmost
efficiency.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only hope of the entente powers is
in a long drawn out war. If given time,
Russia may train her undisciplined hosts.
France will make continuous sacrifices.
Great Britain may focus her resources and
bring them to bear at the point where
they are most needed. If the entente
allies can continue to hold substantially
their present lines for another year, it
would seem that Germany must begin to
show signs of exhaustion. Any hope the
entente allies may have had of invading
Germany and crushing it must at the
present time seem far from alluring.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>A KINDLY VOICE FROM GERMANY</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>That all Germany is not given over
to the doctrine of hate is shown by
the following extract from an
article by Prof. Ernst von Troeltsch in the
Frankfürter Zeitung:</p>

<p class='c017'>“We must not allow hatred to be magnified
into theory or a system or let it be the guiding
maxim that controls our existence. Hatred
may inspire us with courage and driving power,
but it is, politically speaking, in the long run,
an evil counsellor. It gives rise to a bitter and
fantastical idea of politics, which cannot be
pursued, and therefore brings dangerous disappointment
in its train. And in its influence
on our moral and spiritual life hatred is most
dangerous. Everyone is agreed that we need
a deepening of our moral and spiritual sense,
and hopes to see a new Germany rise out of the
unparalleled sacrifices which we have made.
This new Germany is not to be a compound of
hate, but to spring from the creation of new
sources of national strength. All her past
whether it be based on Christian and Conservative
ideas or on Liberal ideals, protests
against race hatred, and all these theories
which base the conduct of real politics on hate—theories
which are not born in the field, but
at the writing-desk, whose standard-bearers
are not soldiers, but the self-important Philistine,
and the bombastic writer at home....
We do not need to cultivate hate, but to
deepen our insight into the terrible seriousness
of the moment, and this all-important hour of
our fate.”</p>

<p class='c019'>If Prof. Troeltsch represents any considerable
body of German sentiment the
note he sounds is an encouraging one.
Every country has its yellow journals, its
pot-house strategists, and its writing-desk
statesmen, who are fond of elaborating
pompous theories and showing their
bravery by delivering hard words instead
of hard knocks. Perhaps a good deal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the quoted literature that comes out of
Germany voicing hated and arrogant
purpose of world-domination originates
with the bombastic Philistines described
by the Professor, and not from the real
representative men of the nation. If so,
when peace comes to be seriously discussed
it may be possible to agree upon terms
that will not be repugnant to our Christian
civilization.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>WAR, BUT NOT FAMINE</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>In allegory and history war
is usually associated with famine.
But fortunately in this otherwise
awful conflict there is so far no general
famine. There are of course sporadic
instances of local suffering from lack of
food in war-devasted regions, but the
belligerent nations, as entities, seem to
have ample supplies. It is officially declared
that Germany has ample stores of
food, and that the promise of the current
year’s harvest is bounteous. It is the
same with Austria and Russia. France
and England have ample food from homegrown
products and importations. The
outlook is for enormous crop yields in both
the United States and Canada. There
seems to be ample ability in the warring
countries to take care of the harvests by
the labor of the men not at the front,
supplemented by the labor of prisoners of
war and of the women and children. The
setting of prisoners of war to work in the
fields is not inhuman. On the contrary,
it is very often a mercy to the prisoners.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pestilence also is the usual accompaniment
of war. There are reports of
pestilence from various quarters, but
modern science has shown itself able to
battle with disease and prevent any
widespread devastation from it.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>STRIKES IN WAR TIME</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Reports of an impending strike
in the Krupp works of Germany
were followed by reports of the
probable universal application of martial
law. It is not probable that any serious
strike will be allowed in Germany. No
nation at war can afford to permit extensive
strikes on the part of its industrial
population. It is not improbable that
Great Britain will be obliged to follow the
example of Germany in suppressing
strikes with the strong hand. When a
nation is fighting for its life it cannot
permit any class or section of its people to
imperil the independence of the country
and the safety of its population by
pursuing a selfish class interest to the
point of paralyzing a vital industry.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>AN INTERESTING FORECAST</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>General and former Judge
Roger A. Pryor, who commanded
a Confederate brigade
during the Civil War, recently indulged
in some war predictions after premising
that “it is foolish to prophecy.” He
expected the fall of Warsaw, and then that
the Germans would conclude a separate
peace with Russia. France would come
next for the same treatment. Then England
would be left to face things. Judge
Pryor added:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is England an old empire that has reached
the stage that ended the history of Greece and
Rome? Perhaps not. Perhaps it is not destined
to go yet, and at the hands of Germany.</p>

<p class='c020'>“But whatever happens, I think the end of
this thing they call militarism will come.
Whoever triumphs, the people, even of the
victorious country, will demand that the
nations’ means be devoted to humanity
rather than war. The people are paying
for this war. They are losing most, and
they know it.</p>

<p class='c020'>“As an old soldier, I can say there is nothing
in war. I have seen enough of it. The world
is not at a stage now where constant killing of
men by their fellows can go on. This war will
be the great lesson.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Whether Judge Pryor’s forecast as to
the military outcome is credible of incredible,
his prediction of the downfall of
militarism is within the bounds of probability.
His verdict that there is nothing
in war jibes with the verdict of
General Grant and many great soldiers.</p>

  <h3 class='c015'>PRESIDENT WILSON’S LAST GERMAN NOTE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The note to Germany from the
Department of State of the
United States, under date of
July 21, 1915, and signed “Lansing,” is
gratifying to the American people by
reason of its firm tone, its manly assertion
of our national dignity, and our purpose
to protect American citizens, as well as
the rights of humanity, upon the seas.
It is not belligerent in expression, but on
the contrary most moderate and courteous.
It leaves the way open for a friendly adjustment,
but appears to be a finality so
far as correspondence is concerned. Germany
can meet our demands by refraining
from the acts of which our government
complains, and our claims for redress and
indemnity for past acts can be left for
future adjustment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately, there is not now in the
cabinet a Secretary of State to nullify the
moral and practical effect of the note by
secret assurances that it is “intended
only for home consumption.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>“PEACE BY COMPULSION”</h3>

“Peace by Compulsion.” The communication
to which reference was made was,
through some mistake in the make-up,
omitted from the pages of the August

found in this number. Mr. Scott sets
forth some of the weaknesses and inconsistencies
of the plan proposed
by the Philadelphia League of Peace

<h3 class='c015'>NATIONS STILL IN THE CAVEMAN ERA</h3>

<p class='c017'>While international law has by agreement
laid down certain rules regarding the conduct
of war, it is recognized that there exists no
central authority that is able to enforce compliance
with these arguments. But, as regards
the right of a nation to declare war for any
reason, even for openly alleged plunder and
conquest, there is no precept of restraint and
no recognized right of interference. Although
the right to invade, subdue and appropriate
without provocation cannot be established as
a right to inherit in any sovereign state by any
process of juridical reasoning, nevertheless it is
a recognized prerogative which international
law does not, and under existing conceptions
of sovereignty cannot, forbid. One of the
greatest authorities on the subject says:
“Theoretically, international law ought to determine
the causes for which war can be justly
undertaken—in other words, it ought to mark
out as plainly as municipal law what constitutes
a wrong for which a remedy may be
sought in law. It might also not unreasonably
go on to discourage the commission of wrongs
by investigating a state seeking redress with
special rights, and by subjecting a wrong-doer
to special disabilities.” But in fact it does
nothing of the kind. International law
accepts war, independently of the justice of its
origin, as a relation which the parties to it may
set up if they choose, and which any nation
may, if it chooses, impose upon another
against its will. The law confines itself to
nominally regulating the effects of the relations.—Dr.
David Jayne Hill in <cite>Review of
Reviews</cite>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>The above declaration from a well
known authority upon international
law shows how unsatisfactory
is the present status of the
recognized law of nations, and how inadequate,
not to say impotent, it is to preserve
the peace among nations. We
glean from other authoritative writers on
the subject that the Moral Law which is
almost universally held to be binding upon
the individuals of a nation with respect to
internal affairs must, in the case of the
nation as a whole, give way to the
necessity of self-preservation, and that
under this rule everything deemed necessary
to the preservation of the life of the
nation is justified. Dr. Hill remarks that
even the control of international law upon
the conduct of war is wholly illusory, as is
evident from the fact that the so-called
laws of war cannot be enforced by a non-belligerent
co-signatory of the convention
in which the agreement is made without
the non-belligerent itself going to war to
execute such enforcement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Therefore the nations of the world, regarded
as individual entities, are in
precisely the same relation to each
other as were the individual cave-men of
the prehistoric era. Each cave-man was
a law unto himself and existed by virtue
of his strength and cunning. If one cave-man
made a compact with another to
unite for mutual defense there was no outside
power to make either one keep the
agreement save by compulsion, or to
respect the life and property of friend or
enemy. There was no moral law among
the cave-men, and there is at present no
enforceable law among nations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plan of a World Court for Judicial
Settlement proposes to introduce among
nations enforceable international laws
which would tend to prevent war altogether
by compelling nations to live up to
the recognized rules of international
morality. It would do for nations what
civilized institutions have done for the individuals
of nations.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE WAR PATH OR THE WORLD STATE</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>This is the key-note of a powerful
article by H. G. Wells, in a
recent issue of the New York
<cite>Times</cite>. His argument, is that “Man’s
increasing power of destruction, unchecked
will overwhelm Hope, Beauty and Freedom
in the World.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The submarine and the aircraft have
made the horrors of war inescapable by
the civil population of any country. The
development of destructive weapons during
the present war has been marvellous.
It seems inevitable that capacity for
offense will be so developed in time that
no ship will be safe from torpedoes on
ocean, river or lake, and that no city or
hamlet, or even remote farmhouse, will be
exempt from destruction by aërial bombs.
What is to prevent a fleet of enemy’s aircraft
from burning up the crops of any
given region, condemning the inhabitants
to starvation? This thought can be
expanded ad libitum by those who keep
pace with the march of invention, and
who realize that just now destructive invention
outpaces constructive invention
and the science of conservation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old scope of war was sufficiently
horrible, when it mainly threatened
fortresses, battle-fields and men liable to
military service. But now its threat is
universal, against whole populations, on
land and water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Therefore the question of universal
peace is now of vital interest not alone to
the statesman, the ruler, the general and
the financier, but to “the man in the
street,” to the ordinary citizen, to every
woman, and to every little child. It
always concerned all these in a general
way, but now it is brought intimately
home to all, because war can at any moment
put any individual in imminent
personal deadly peril of life or limb.</p>

<p class='c008'>Is there a possibility of preventing wars
in the future short of the adoption of a
counsel of perfection—that is to say, the
substantial regeneration of human nature
to the moral elevation of the mind that
was in the Prince of Peace? There is
manifestly only one way to approximate
universal peace among men so long as
they remain in an unregenerate state.
And that is a union or welding of nations
into what might be called a World-State.</p>

<p class='c008'>The model is the nation itself. Internal
peace is preserved in a civilized and virile
nation by the establishment of constitutional
safeguards and of institutions
of government. Not all the individuals
of a nation can be trusted to keep the
peace. The non-peaceable are held in
check by laws and by the provisions made
for the execution of the laws. To this end
nations have legislative bodies, executives
and courts. The executives have placed
under their command armies and police
forces to restrain the wicked. With all
the machinery of executives and courts
and police forces crime is not entirely prevented,
nor violence suppressed. People
are assaulted and murdered, but in a well-ordered
nation the infractions of the law
are trifling as compared with the aggregate
of peaceful life.</p>

<p class='c008'>So in a World-State. War and violence
might not be entirely prevented, but the
aggregate of peaceful life would be so extended
as to save civilization and permit
moral and material progress. Mr. Wells
well says:</p>

<p class='c017'>The course of human history is downward
and very dark indeed unless our race can give
mind and will, now unreservedly in unprecedented
abundance, to the stern necessities
that follow logically from the aircraft bomb
and the poison gas and that silent, invisible,
unattainable murderer, the submarine.</p>

<p class='c019'>The way to achieve a World-State was
clearly pointed out by the Cleveland
World Court Congress. It is doubtful if
any other method is workable than to
begin with the establishment of a World
Supreme Court for Judicial Settlement
backed by ample physical force to curb
unruly nations. No one contends that
such a tribunal can be made effective without
the coöperation of the first class
powers, or a decisive majority of them.
The task of the United States, after the
conclusion of the present bloody war, will
be to bring these great nations together
in a world-conference to perfect the plan
for a World-State.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>CHINA AND JAPAN</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Japan has seized this time, when the
European powers are engaged in a
hand-to-hand struggle for existence,
to begin the work of the consolidation
of the yellow races. Japanese statesmen
have explained her position as that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>mediator between the West and the East.
Japan does not desire to be the mediator
between the West and the East. She
wants to be the East.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This is the conclusion reached by
Samuel G Blythe, in a recent magazine
article discussing the demands made by
Japan upon China on the 18th of January
last. The original demands were somewhat
modified before acceptance by
China, but in their modified form they
virtually give Japan the hegemony of
China. China accepted under a tacit
threat of war, because China was militarily
too weak to resist Japan, and because
China knew that she could not look
for help at this juncture either from
Great Britain or the United States. The
British Empire is engaged in a struggle for
its own existence: The United States, in
a military sense, is almost as weak as
China, and faces too many possibilities of
complications with some or all of the
European powers to make it safe to allow
its attention to be diverted by the possibility
of war with Japan.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no reason to believe that Japan
has any aggressive designs upon the
United States. In fact, the execution of
her design of becoming, as Mr. Blythe
expresses it, “The East,” bids fair to
occupy her attention to such an extent as
to preclude the idea of Japan seeking
trouble with this country. But that
Japan would stand on the defensive and
resist with her full military power any
attempt on our part to intervene in behalf
of China, goes without saying. If we
have war with Japan we shall have to
carry the war to Japan, and that, in the
present condition of world affairs, is unthinkable.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the present cynical attitude of the
white and so-called Christian nations
toward each other, it is not surprising that
a heathen nation like Japan should resolve
to take advantage of her superior physical
strength to push her own interests. She
claims to be a civilized nation, and so do
Christian nations engaged in the great
European war claim to be civilized. But
their civilization is not allowed to stand in
the way of their ambitions. It is natural
that Japan should aspire to be the controlling
power of Asia. She is the only
Asiatic power that is fit for such a task
or that could hope to accomplish such a
design.</p>

<p class='c008'>For Japan to hold her hand now and
restrain her ambition when the folly of the
great European nations has offered her an
opportunity which may never occur
again, would be an act of extreme self-abnegation
even on the part of a Christian.
Can we expect a higher standard of
world-ethics from a heathen? Looking
the situation squarely in the face, we may
expect to see Japan set her foot upon the
neck of China and subdue that country
politically and economically to her will,
for China has no power of organized
resistance. We may then expect to see
Japan set up a sort of Monroe Doctrine of
Asia. She will undoubtedly allow Great
Britain to retain India, as Great Britain
is already established there, just as we
allow Great Britain to retain Canada—but
Japan will say to Europe and America,
“Hands off!” as to new acquisitions
in Asia. She will probably not attempt
to interfere with the United States in the
Philippines, but if we should make up our
minds to abandon the Philippines, Japan
might extend her protection over the
Filipino Republic to prevent it coming
under the influence of any other great
power.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for China, there is reason to believe
that Japan’s protectorate over it, or
absorption of it, will be beneficial to the
people of that country in many ways.
The Chinese have shown no capacity for
organization or self-government. They
have shown no capacity to develop the
magnificent resources of their vast territory.
Under Japanese efficiency China
will be developed, and Japan, occupied in
this task of development, will have no
time to meddle with American affairs or to
seek to push any colonizing enterprise on
the American continents. The passing of
Asia under the virtual suzerainty of an
Asiatic power that has displayed a
capacity for civilization and modern
progress may be one of the compensations
of the great world war. As for American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>trade in the aggregate, it should be helped
rather than injured by the awakening of
the sleeping Celestial giant to the touch of
Progress.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ENGLAND AND THE DISINHERITED</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The present war may prove a blessing
in disguise to England if it
leads to social reorganization on a
more rational and effective basis. The
weakness of England, as developed during
the past year, has been in lack of unity and
organization. There has been not only too
much political, but too much class division.
The remark has frequently been
made, “Why doesn’t England wake up?”
There has not been the same effective
coöperation among all classes that has
been apparent in Germany and in France.
The English government has been in times
past careless or neglectful in allowing the
developement of slums and of a “submerged
tenth,” while what are called the
upper classes have been too intent on the
pursuit of pleasure to give due heed to the
privation and suffering of those occupying
a lower social scale. This is measurably
true of society in all countries, but it is
notorious that the “upper classes” in
England have been zealously devoted to
sports, week-end holidays, social functions
and the pursuit of gain, while the operative
classes have antagonized them in
labor organizations, and the lower working
classes have been neglected and
thrown upon the poor rates. This has
bred social divisions which even the pressure
of war finds difficult to heal. If
this war is fought through to success by
the working people of England, as it must
be if England is successful, because the
working people furnish the bulk of the
army and navy and the toilers in the
factories, they will undoubtedly demand
a rearrangement of social forces which will
give them a more equitable participation
in the prosperity of the country. German
efficiency teaches the world that no nation
can permit the growth within its boundaries
of a proletariat that feels itself disinherited.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ACTION VERSUS WORDS</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>There are many who think that the
proper reply to the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i> and the taking of American
lives without warning would have
been the calling of Congress in extra session
and the appropriation of a billion dollars
or more for increasing the American
army and navy and coast defenses. They
argue that this would not have been a
measure of war, but on the contrary a measure
of peace, as it would have shown that
this country meant to protect its citizens
and that no nation would ever venture to
attack us if they saw that we meant to be
prepared. The military authorities say
that it will take us several years to place
ourselves in a condition to fight any one
of the first-class European powers with
any prospect of success. Orville Wright
says that we need two thousand æroplanes
which might be built in a year, and Mr.
Lake says we need at least a hundred and
fifty submarines, which might be built
within two years, and a goodly proportion
of them in one year. If we need to
prepare for defense, and the preparation
takes so long, the sooner we begin the better.
As actions speak louder than words,
President Wilson’s action in calling Congress
together would have conveyed a distinct
impression of our resolution to protect
our nationals and our national
interests, as well against Great Britain as
against Germany, which no “note” can
convey, especially when the force of the
note is undermined by a cabinet officer
with the secret assurance to the ambassador
of a foreign power that the note was
merely for home consumption! Fortunately,
however, for the credit of President
Wilson’s administration, his cabinet
is now purged of such secret folly and
treachery.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE DUTY OF THE HOUR</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The view taken by the more sober
and serious advocates of stronger
armament by the United States is
expressed by the publication, <cite>The Army
and Navy Journal</cite>, in a recent issue, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the caption, “The Duty of the Hour.” It
says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is there no possibility of bringing home to
official diligence an apprehension of the fact
that preparation for defence, so far from involving
us in war, is the best defense against
war, as is shown by little Switzerland holding
calmly on its path of peace in the midst of
warring nations? All the powers respect the
neutrality of Switzerland because they know
that she is prepared to fight for her independence
to the last man, and that she is at all
times ready for immediate action in defense of
her mountain fastnesses, so that she is a
power to be reckoned with.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Switzerland is a poor country and does
not greatly tempt any of the belligerent
nations by her wealth. The Swiss are
tough fighters, their country, by reason of
its mountainous situation, is a very
defensible one, and its subjugation would
undoubtedly cost any power more than
the conquest would be worth. The case
is very different with the United States.
This is the richest country in the world,
actually and potentially. Any power
which could occupy its coast cities would
be able to levy indemnities which would
richly pay them for the financial cost of
any war. Human nature being what it is,
such wealth is a constant temptation to
any predatory power. The ocean does
not protect us as it formerly did, but on
the contrary affords a convenient highway
for invasion. Such wealth as ours needs
protection in the present status of world-morality.
There is no thought of aggression
on the part of our people. The
United States will never arm for aggression.
But it should be strong enough to
keep its goods in peace and to save its
population from the horrors of invasion.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE ARISTOCRACY OF LABOR</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>William James’s essay on
the moral equivalents of war
advocated conscription for
peace of all youths, rich or poor, to do the
hard, rough and disagreeable work—the
labor of the mills, the coal, iron and other
mines, the work of railroad building and
transportation, to man the fishing fleets in
December and the harvest fields in
August, the digging of tunnels and
foundations, the erection of the frames of
skyscrapers, and the varied work of land
reclamation and cultivation. This of
course would have to be done under a
system of State Socialism, as everybody is
naturally looking for the easier jobs. But
the plan would hardly work under the
present system of individualism and freedom
of choice in occupation and the
pursuit of happiness. But one thing the
State might do, in organizing its educational
facilities, is to give more attention
to and provide more facilities for a vocational
education. There is a surplus in all
communities of clerical labor and of
people who are seeking to do what they
call brainwork, rather than muscle work.
But the need of the world is for strong
muscle workers, for manual skill combined
with intelligence. Our schools afford
ample facilities for the acquirement of
book education, and the importance of
book education has been so magnified that
the lighter tasks have come to be extensively
regarded as in some way more
genteel than the harder ones. Sentiment,
however, is changing, as is shown by the
fact that skilled mechanics as a rule
command better pay and steadier employment
than the mere clerical workers.
Applied science and skill have come to
occupy so important a place in our modern
social life that the skilled manual worker
is now the real aristocrat among workers.
This trend in the distribution of tasks will
do away with the need of drafting men for
the hard work. The higher pay and the
higher honor of such work will steadily
draw the superior brawn and brain of our
youth into what may be aptly called the
manlier occupations.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE EVENTS</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The fact is recalled that Dr. David
Starr Jordan, one of the most
prominent of the pacifists who
decry armament and preparedness, said
in an article on “War and Waste,” published
in 1913: “What shall we say of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the Great War of Europe ever threatening,
ever impending, and which never
comes? We shall say that it will never
come. Humanly speaking, it is impossible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Prophecy, by a mere mortal, is always
exceedingly dangerous. We all hope, and
we may firmly believe, that the United
States will never be compelled to engage
in another war, but to make a definite
prediction that war will never come to us
would be folly.</p>

<p class='c008'>If war is ever to come, the question for
this country to solve is, whether we shall
prepare to meet it before it comes, or
after it comes. Hudson Maxim, who has
recently issued a large book to argue for
preparedness, is seemingly quite hopeless
that his advice will be taken. He
says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Pacifism has ringed the nose of the American
people and is leading them, blind and unknowing,
to the slaughter. War is inevitable.
It matters not that if this country could be
roused, it might be saved. When it is impossible
to vitalize the impulse necessary to
the accomplishment of a thing, that thing is
impossible. So I say, war is inevitable and
imminent. The American people could not
now be roused sufficiently to avert the impending
calamity even by a call that would
rift the sky and shake down the stars from
heaven! Fate has decreed that our pride shall
be humbled, and that we shall be bowed to
the dirt. We must first put on sackcloth,
ashed in the embers of our burning homes.
Perhaps, when we build anew on the fire-blackened
desolation, our mood may be receptive
of the knowledge that we must shield our
homes with blood and brawn and iron.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Let us hope that this dismal prophecy
will not be fulfilled. Let us hope that it
is as wide of the mark as was Dr. Jordan’s
prophecy that there would never be another
great war in Europe. Yet if one
is to play the prophet, it is better to
prophecy evil things that put us on our
guard, than smooth things that cause us
to run heedlessly into danger.</p>

<p class='c017'>Winston Churchill, the young English statesman,
once began to raise a mustache, and while
it was still in the budding stage he was asked
at a dinner party to take out to dinner an English
girl who had decided opposing political
views.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I am sorry,” said Mr. Churchill, “we can
not agree on politics.”</p>

<p class='c020'>“No, we can’t,” rejoined the girl, “for to be
frank with you I like your politics about as
little as I do your mustache.”</p>

<p class='c020'>“Well,” replied Mr. Churchill, “remember
that you are not really likely to come into
contact with either.”</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c020'>After his first lecturing tour in this country
Matthew Arnold visited old Mrs. Proctor, the
widow of the poet Barry Cornwall, and mother
of Adelaide Proctor. Mrs. Proctor, giving
Mr. Arnold a cup of tea, asked him, “And
what did they say about you in America?”
“Well,” said the literary autocrat, “they said
I was conceited, and they said my clothes did
not fit me.” “Well, now,” said the old lady,
“I think they were mistaken as to the clothes.”</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>THE WORLD COURT MOVEMENT</h2>
</div>

    <div>HON. THEODORE MARBURG</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>The World Court idea is not
new. It has been the thought
of eminent men—scholars,
churchmen, publicists, occasionally
statesmen—at intervals
for generations. Our own William
Penn put forward in 1693 a plan to
prevent wars. In 1795 the famous
German philosopher, Immanuel Kant,
published his essay on “Perpetual Peace,”
a fundamental conception in which
was that wars would not cease until
all the governments of the world were
democratic. The great English lawyer,
Jeremy Bentham, whose speculations fertilized
so many departments of law
and social endeavor, likewise elaborated
a plan. Other men at other times, before
and since these, have turned their
thoughts to this subject. In our own
country we have had men such as Elihu
Burritt (1810–79) and Charles Sumner
(1811–74) who have influenced, not only
the people of America, but of the whole
world. The first peace society was
formed in New York, 1815, followed by
one in England the ensuing year. It
was Burritt who organized the Brussels
Congress of Friends of Peace in 1848
and this was followed by the important
gatherings in Paris, Frankfurt, London,
Manchester, and Edinburgh. The great
congress in Paris (1849) was presided over
by Victor Hugo. Then there burst upon
the world a series of wars, beginning with
the Crimean War and the war in Italy,
followed by the Austro-Prussian War
and the Franco-Prussian War, and the
peace movement was stilled for a full
generation. Presently, there came renewed
interest. Men began to examine
the records of peaceful settlement of disputes;
they found hundreds of instances
of successful arbitration, our country—direction
having been given to it by the
Jay Treaty—being distinctly a leader
in this field. They found that the awards
of the arbitral tribunals were uniformly
respected, that it was not necessary to
use force to execute the verdict.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been suggested that possibly one
explanation of this fact is that the more
acute questions, over which there was
great popular feeling, were not submitted
to arbitration. However this may be,
the fact is that we had an unbroken
record of the acceptance of the verdict
of arbitral tribunals until within the last
few years. The apparent exception in
this record is the arbitration over the
Canadian boundary between Great Britain
and the United States. It was found
that the arbitrator, the King of the
Netherlands, had exceeded the terms of
the “compromise”—the agreement under
which the arbitration was submitted—and
the award was set aside by mutual
agreement of the two countries, so that
this case can not really be looked upon as
a refusal by the loser to accept the award.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the past few years we have seen
arbitrations thrown down by three South
American and Central American countries.
I do not feel that this, either, is
very significant, because of the character
of the countries which brought about this
break in the long and splendid record.
Owing either to their undeveloped condition
or to the nature of the people, or
both, these countries are frequently unable
to maintain law and order within
their own borders and are at times either
unwilling or unable to carry out the verdicts
of an international tribunal. It
would therefore seem unfair to let a
valuable principle suffer because it has
been disregarded by a people whose backward
condition makes it unlikely in advance
that they will prove equal to the
task of living up to it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>From this general criticism of the Latin-American
countries must be excepted
what are known as the “ABC” countries.
Two of them, Argentine and Chile, enjoy
a stable government. The stability of
the other, Brazil, is less certain but still
sufficient to place it among the progressive
Powers of the world. This term,
progressive Powers, I shall have occasion
to use later and therefore should like
to define it now. It is a mistake to follow
the common disposition of the times and
measure progress in terms of numbers—growth
of population, pounds of steel,
or yards of cotton turned out. Progress
is to be sought in things other than the
material, in the growth of the ethical,
intellectual, and spiritual forces, above
all, in justice: social justice, the justice of
man to man, justice of employer to employe,
justice of the State towards its
people, justice written in the law, and
justice of nation to nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, this recognition of the success
of arbitration, combined with a realization
of the unintelligent methods by
which countries regulate their relations
with each other, and above all the waste
and danger of competition in armaments,
led to the call for an international
conference which met at The Hague in
1900. No progress whatever was made
at the conference on the question of disarmament,
for which primarily the conference
was called. But there did emerge
from it new institutions which were not
looked for but which were a real gain to
the world. I refer first of all to the
Permanent Court of Arbitration, which
you will remember has decided several
difficult questions, among them the Casa
Blanca affair between France and Germany,
at one time quite acute. There
emerged also an international Commission
of Inquiry, which, in 1904, proved
of the highest value. You will remember
that the Russian Admiral Rodjesvensky,
emerging from the Baltic, thought that
he discovered an enemy in some innocent
English fishermen. He attacked
them sank a ship and killed several men.
Now, in the minds of many men that
incident might have led to war the next
day—a generation before it would undoubtedly
have led to war. But there
happened to have been set up by the
First Hague Conference this institution,
the Commission of Inquiry. The question
was referred to it and it was found
that Rodjesvensky, however foolishly,
still honestly believed he saw in these
fishermen Japanese warships. Moreover
time was given for national passion to
subside. As a result there was no war
between Russia and England and in the
opinion of statesmen of the day, the fact
that there was no war was due largely to
the existence of this institution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, too, at the First Hague Conference,
Good Offices and Mediation were
recognized for the first time as friendly
functions. It was agreed that if a country
should offer its good offices to two
countries on the verge of war, or at war,
this act should not be regarded as unwarranted
interference but as a friendly act.
It was under that institution, you will
remember, that Mr. Roosevelt succeeded
in bringing Japan and Russia together
at Portsmouth and so terminating, earlier
than would otherwise have been the case,
the Russo-Japanese War. A second
peace conference took place at The
Hague in 1907. The task of improving
the rules of war which had been begun
at the First Conference was carried forward
at the Second Conference. The
Second Congress, moreover, adopted in
fact an institution known as the International
Court of Prize. Then it adopted
in principle the Court of Arbitral Justice,
intended to be a true international court
of justice, composed of judges by profession,
whose tenure should be permanent.
This latter institution was to be brought
into being through diplomatic channels
as soon as the nations should agree upon
the method of selecting the judges. The
reason the court is not in existence to-day
is that up to this time such a method of
selecting the judges has not been found,
and this is one of the subjects up for
discussion this afternoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, why did the Second Hague Conference
vote for this Court of Arbitral
Justice when we already had in existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>working successfully, the Permanent
Court of Arbitration set up by the First
Hague Conference? The reasons were
several. In the first place, the Permanent
Court of Arbitration was not a court
of law. Its decisions were to be based
upon the principles of law but at the
same time its functions were those of arbitration,
and, as you know, the main
object of the arbitrator is to bring about
the settlement of a dispute. That is to
say, he is more interested in that, which
often involves compromise, than he is
in bringing out the true justice of the
case which would tend to develop the
principles of law and enlarge accepted
practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, those of us who believe in this
true court of justice for the world feel
that international law would be built up
by it in two ways. First, it would grow
through the decisions of the judges themselves
in cases actually coming before
them, the judge being governed by previous
decisions of the Court—the way
in which the great Common Law of England
has grown. That process produces
the most natural, healthy, sound, and
permanent kind of law. Then it is felt
that the existence of this court will invite
the codification of certain spheres
of law. An example in point is the way
in which the provision for the International
Court of Prize led to the London
Conference of 1908–1909, at which the
law of prize was codified. England declined
to proceed with the project of the
International Prize Court until that was
done. Hitherto the law of prize has
depended upon the interpretation each
nation has placed upon it. One nation
might set up as contraband that which
another nation declined to accept as
contraband. Questions of how long an
enemy’s ship should be suffered to remain
in a neutral port, whether merchantmen
may lawfully be converted into armed
cruisers after leaving home waters, and
numerous similar questions, were differently
answered by different countries.
England said “we must know what we
are undertaking.” Therefore, at her
instance the conference met at London
and evolved the London Convention
which codifies the law of prize. When
the present war began, Germany announced
her willingness to accept the
Convention. On the other hand, England,
who had not yet ratified the Convention
(owing to the opposition of the
Lords), proceeded to modify it and proclaimed
it in this modified form. France
did the same. It was accepted in its
original form by the United States Senate
but not promulgated by the President,
who took the position that the United
States could not accept a convention
in which several nations had introduced
their own amendments not agreed to by
all. But the history of the London Convention
shows how the existence of an
international court will invite the codification
of certain spheres of international
law. I use that term advisedly because
it is a tremendous undertaking to codify
the whole body of international law,
nor is it certain that it is advisable so to
do. It may become too rigid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, that project of the Second Hague
Conference, the Court of Arbitral Justice,
was accepted by the forty-four
nations participating in the conference.
It was indorsed in 1912 by the Institute
of International Law. It has been supported
earnestly by all the Powers, including
Germany, France, and England;
and every lawyer, every man who feels
what justice means, approves of it.
There is no difference of opinion as to the
desirability of putting it into effect.
The name of the proposed court, the
Court of Arbitral Justice, is misleading.
The word “arbitral” does not belong
there. It was put in because Germany
insisted on its being there. The word
“court” carries with it the idea of obligation.
When a court in municipal
law renders a decision, usually an obligation
goes with it. Now, Germany was
not ready for anything obligatory in international
institutions; therefore her
demand. But a true court of justice
is none the less provided for by the convention.
From time to time for generations,
isolated individuals have put forward
the idea of such a court. The present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>movement to create it was really born in
the mind of a man who sits upon this
platform, James Brown Scott. He was
connected with the Department of State
under Mr. Root, and, as Mr. Root himself
expressed it, he talked with Mr.
Root once too often about this court.
The result was that the American delegation
to the Second Hague Conference
went there with instructions from Mr.
Root to establish the court if possible.
Mr. Scott took an active part in drawing
up the convention relating to the court
and has been an earnest worker in the
cause ever since. He has gotten a lot of
us interested in it and may be said to be
the father of the modern project.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1910 we formed a society known as
the American Society for Judicial Settlement
of International Disputes to promote
this court.</p>

<p class='c008'>The society has had four annual meetings,
the proceedings of which have appeared
in four substantial volumes.
Besides, it publishes a quarterly usually
limited to one article on the subject by
some prominent man. The Proceedings
have been translated, have been liberally
quoted by foreign publicists, and have
made a profound impression upon public
opinion not only here but in other countries.
The distinguished Foreign Minister
of The Netherlands, Jonkheer Loudon,
said we had demonstrated the feasibility
and the necessity for this world court.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Proceedings and the papers in the
Quarterly published by the society have
been of a scientific character designed
to examine the project and to expose
the principles which should guide the
founders of the court and govern the
court itself when established. But Mr.
John Hays Hammond, an ex-president
of the society, was not satisfied that this
project should remain in the academic
stage. He conceived the idea, with Dr.
John Wesley Hill, of a public propaganda
in the United States in favor of it. We
have had several meetings in the West,
a very large one in Akron, and a number
in the East, all of which culminated in
The World Court Congress held May 12,
1915, in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, conjointly with this project
there is in the minds of many of us a desire
to have the world go a step farther
and introduce the element of obligation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Hamilton Holt is one of the principal
advocates of this latter idea, which
is nothing less than a league of peace.
The subject was put forward by him in
September in <cite>The Independent</cite>. Then he
came to me with the suggestion that we
should have a public conference. We
first got together a group of about twenty
scientific men, professors of political
science, of international law, of history,
of economics, threw the subject into the
arena and had it torn to pieces by them
at three meetings held at the Century
Club in New York. In this way was
worked out what we regarded as a “desirable”
plan. We then took this “desirable”
plan and on April ninth, laid it
before men of wide practical experience,
including Mr. Taft and Mr. A. Lawrence
Lowell, in order to ascertain how much
of it was, in their opinion, a “realizable”
project. It was found that they were
not ready to accept as realizable the whole
of the plan of the first group, which was
practically this: a league of peace which
shall bind its members to resort to a tribunal
for the settlement of all disputes
to which a member of the league may be a
party, and obligate them to use force,
if necessary, both, to bring the nation
law-breaker into court and to execute
the verdict of the court.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, when you introduce the element
of force into your plan you find that the
unanimity of opinion to which I have
referred as applying to the Court of Arbitral
Justice as at present proposed, and to
similar purely voluntary institutions,
no longer exists; that there is very great
diversity of opinion as to whether force
should be used against a nation under
any circumstances. The reason for this
diversity of opinion is the shortcomings
of the leagues of the past. The Quadruple
Alliance, the Grand Alliance, and
the Holy Alliance, all formed immediately
after the Napoleonic wars, were by no
means wholly beneficial. The Holy Alliance
set up between Prussia, Russia, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Austria in 1815, ostensibly to promote
Christianity, but really to support dynasties
and combat the democratic tendency
of the times, operated in fact to suppress
liberty in Hungary, in Italy, and in Spain.
You will remember that it was the Holy
Alliance acting through France as a mandatory
which overthrew the liberal form
of government in Spain and restored full
autocratic powers to the king. Then
there were the partial successes and many
failures of the Concert of Europe. The
Concert of Europe has done some good
things. It smashed the Turkish fleet
in 1827 and liberated Greece. It has
prevented more than one Balkan war.
It has improved the lot of the Armenians
in Turkey. But it has had many failures,
this present disastrous war the most
conspicuous of them. Then there were
these groups like the Triple Alliance and
the Triple Entente, which, though set up
for purposes of peace, have really given
to the present war its broad character.
All of us felt that owing to their existence,
when war came again to Europe it must
be a general war. The breaking out of
war surprised many people; its extent surprised
no one.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manifestly, then, the first step in planning
a league of peace is to find out why
the leagues of the past have failed. I
think the answer lies in one thing: the
narrowness of the group composing the
league, permitting of the triumph of
selfish interests, permitting of collusion,
the swapping of favors, and resulting in
injustice and oppression. That is what
men fear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, many of us believe that if we
can set up a league so broad as to include
all the progressive nations, big and little,
it will be permanent and successful. I
have defined what I mean by the word
progressive. Such a league would include
the eight great nations of the world,
among them the United States and
Japan. It would include the secondary
Powers of Europe—Switzerland, Norway
and Sweden, Denmark, Belgium,
such as it was and such as it will be again,
Spain, Greece, and in fact, all the countries
of Europe, with the possible exception
of some of the Balkan States and
the certain exception of Turkey. The
“ABC” countries of South America
would also be included. It would not include
the backward countries, because we
feel that the country which can not maintain
law and order within its own borders
would bring no strength to the league.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, we believe that such a group
would be successful. In the first place,
it would embrace three great nations
with common political ideals—England,
France, and the United States. I put
our country last for reasons of politeness
only. These three peoples feel that
democratic government is no longer a
passing phase of political experiment but
a permanent fact in politics. Therefore
they would cling together. Then you
have in the group two great nations—Great
Britain and the United States—who
may be said to be satisfied territorially;
you have the secondary Powers of
Europe who have no disturbing ambitions
and whose voice would be for reason
and justice, so that we think that if we
could get these states associated together
in a league, substantial justice would
emerge, just as substantial justice results
from the united action of the forty-eight
states composing the American
Union.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whether you believe this league is
practical or not depends on your answer
to that question: whether justice would
emerge from its united action. Unless
it does justice it can not endure. Unless
it does justice we don’t want it: we don’t
want oppression. Injustice within a country—persistent
injustice—sooner or
later brings war; if not civil war then foreign
war, or both; just as gross injustice
in the conduct of a war will draw into the
struggle an ever widening circle of nations,
because there are irresistible forces
which insist that justice shall emerge
finally in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, it was not proposed that this
league should itself pass upon disputes.
All it would do is to insist that members,
party to the league, or any nation having
a dispute with a member of the league
shall not resort to war. It may refer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the disputants to existing institutions
at The Hague or to other institutions to
be hereafter set up. They shall be privileged
to go on with their dispute indefinitely
if they choose, but they may not resort
to war. The United States, under
this plan, would have been permitted
to continue the Fisheries dispute with
Great Britain, as it did, for three-quarters
of a century without interference;
but if either Great Britain or the United
States had shown a disposition to resort
to arms the league would have been invoked
and would have used its combined
forces to prevent aggression.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are four ideas or stages in the
conception. The first is simply a true
court of justice to which nations may
refer their disputes, if they see fit to do
so. This is the court called for by The
Hague Convention of 1907 under the
name of the Court of Arbitral Justice.
It is the court which the Judicial Settlement
Society was organized to promote.
It is the court which we are endeavoring
to get realized—simply a voluntary institution.
Now, why did the World
Court Congress plan to confine its
efforts, its propaganda, to this voluntary
institution, free from any element of
force? I repeat, it is because there is
unanimity of opinion as to the desirability
of the project. You find no objectors to
it. Practically all the Governments of
the world have endorsed it, peoples have
endorsed it, experts and plain men have
endorsed it. In other words, it is a
realizable project.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, the second stage of the larger
and more problematic project is a league
in which the element of obligation enters
to this extent, that the members of the
league, if you call it such—parties to the
treaty—should obligate themselves to
resort to the court. At present there is
no obligation embodied in The Hague
Convention. Like all our other international
institutions, it is there for the
nations to use or not, as they like.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the third stage, the element of
obligation is extended to forcing the
nations into court. That is to say, if
war threatens, we say to the disputants,
“You must refer this dispute to the
court. We will not force you to carry
out the award nor do you bind yourself
to do so, but you must go into court and
have a hearing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, many men have come to realize
that publicity is three-quarters of the
battle for justice. Very often simply
bringing out the facts stops not only
illegal practices, but also unjust practices
not covered by the law, and does it without
resort to a court or even to arbitration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fourth stage is enforcing the award
admittedly giving rise to the danger of
oppression unless you have all the progressive
nations in the league so that substantial
justice would result from its action.
The meeting of April 9th, to which I have
referred, was unwilling to accept the
fourth stage of this plan, namely: enforcing
the verdict. Men like Mr. Taft, with
his wide experience, Mr. Lowell, who has
made a study of governmental institutions,
in fact all except two out of the
twenty eminent and experienced men
gathered at that meeting, were willing
to adopt the first three stages of the plan
as a “realizable” project, namely, the
court, for which this convention stands,
the obligations of the States to each
other to go into court, and the obligation
of the league to force the nation law-breaker
into court if recalcitrant.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there is no obligation on the part of
the nation entering the court to abide
by the verdict and the league itself will
not enforce the verdict, surely no oppression
can result from the demand for a
hearing. It is a reasonable demand as
applied to any controversy whatsoever,
whether it be a justiciable controversy
or a controversy arising out of a conflict
of political policies. The league would
simply act as an international grand jury
to hale the nation law-breaker into court
for a hearing. That is as far as the meeting
of April 9th was willing to go, and
that is the project, represented in the recent
World Court Congress. By starting
with this minor project we get something
which is practicable and out of the
minor project, the larger plan may grow
of its own accord.</p>

    <div>BY</div>
    <div>GEORGE K. SHAW</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>As bearing upon the question
of the ability of the warring
nations to continue the war
indefinitely, Hudson Maxim’s
book, “Defenseless America,”
contains some interesting figures and
comparisons. “We hear,” he says,
“Much about the tremendous burden of
the present conflict. The pacifists tell us
that the nations engaged are destined to
exhaust themselves, and that, when the
war is over, we need have no fear of
any one of them or of a coalition of them,
because they will have neither men nor
money with which to fight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Maxim assumes that the first year
of the war will cost the warring powers
fifteen billions of dollars. But this is only
five per cent. of their total wealth, which
is estimated at $300,000,000,000.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must also be remembered that the
same thing largely holds true in regard to
war expenditures that holds true of current
expenditures in time of peace. The
cost, for the most part, comes out of the
ground. The world makes its peaceful
expenditures and not only recompenses
itself from production, but actually adds
to capital. In war, of course, there is a
lot of non-productive expenditure, but
on the other hand there is some added
stimulus of production and greater enforced
economy in everything save in the
actual expenditures for carrying on the
war. And in the labor of producing war
material, transportation and feeding of
armies, pay of the soldiers and for all
labor incidental to the activities of the
war, the money spent is chiefly returned
to the people themselves. Labor in all
the warring countries is now more highly
compensated than it was prior to the
war. Mr. Hudson estimates that the
actual out-of-pocket loss to the nations
in the present war, taking into account
the compensating economic advantages,
will not exceed two and one half per cent.
for the first year’s operations.</p>

<p class='c008'>In regard to loss of population Mr.
Maxim’s figures are equally striking.
The population of the warring nations is
more than four hundred millions, taking
into account only such part of the East
Indian population in proportion to the
percentage of troops furnished by them
as compared with the percentage furnished
by the United Kingdom to the
number of its inhabitants. The total
number killed and wounded in the whole
war, on both sides, during the first six
months may be stated at about two millions.
Consequently the total loss in
killed and wounded during the first six
months was less than a half of one per
cent. of the populations engaged. Many
of the wounded suffer very little permanent
injury, and the number killed does
not exceed ten per cent. of the total of
killed and wounded. Therefore the loss of
killed and permanently disabled is much
less than half of one per cent., and for the
first year will hardly exceed one per cent.</p>

<p class='c008'>If these estimates are anywhere near
correct, it would be a long time before the
nations engaged in this gigantic war could
be exhausted either in wealth or men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some interesting light is thrown upon
the ability of one of the warring countries,
Germany, to carry on the war indefinitely
by a letter written by Prof. Max Sering,
of the University of Berlin, to W. S.
McNeill, of Richmond, Virginia, and
published in a recent issue of the New
York <cite>Times</cite>. Prof. Sering was asked by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Mr. McNeill for information as to whether
Germany would be able to get along with
her food and war material supply. Heretofore,
he says, Germany has been in the
habit of importing from one fifth to one
fourth of all her food material and foodstuffs.
The shutting off of her sea commerce
led to a search for substitutes and
also to governmental regulations for
economizing supplies. As a result of the
unceasing labor of scientists and practical
inventors, Prof. Sering announces that
the problems of supply have been completely
solved in every direction. “We
can now,” he triumphantly announces,
“continue the war indefinitely. The
complete cutting off of the supply of
Chili saltpetre during the war has been
made good by our now taking nitrogen
directly out of the air. With extraordinary
rapidity the question had been
solved how the enormous quantities of
the needed ammunition was to be produced.
It is, however, not only for the
needed explosives that we take the nitrogen
from the air, but also for fertilizers
which we formerly imported in the form
of Chilean saltpetre. As for foodstuffs,
the government, on February 1, 1915, took
over all the grain and prescribed to each
one a certain portion of bread and flour.
In the beginning this portion was somewhat
scant because we wanted to be sure
that our supply would last until the new
crop. Now, however, it is found that
we are entering the new crop year with
such large stocks that the price of flour
and bread could be reduced considerably
and the bread portion of the working
population could be enlarged. Potatoes,
also which for a time were very expensive,
have lately become quite cheap. Unemployment
is now less than before the
war, the workmen receive higher wages,
and the masses are well nourished. The
supply of meat will become somewhat
scant by and by, but that does not matter,
as we have been in the habit of eating
too much meat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the war proceeds it is inevitable
that the other countries engaged in it,
whether hostile or friendly, will take example
from Germany and resort to measures
to conserve and increase their
material resources. Modern science has
wonderfully unlocked the storehouses of
nature, and increased energy and industry
can to some extent make good the
waste and destruction of war. We cannot
therefore expect to see the war end
very soon from the exhaustion of any of
the combatants. This is the outlook of
the war in its physical aspect. What
political or moral forces may be evoked
to shorten it is beyond our ken.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Hudson Maxim’s book was written
to call attention to the practically defenseless
condition of the United States
and to urge adequate preparation. We
do not care to follow him in his voluminous
argument on this score, but the
concluding paragraph of his ninth chapter,
to the effect that “when the war is over,
any one of the warring powers, unless
Germany is exceedingly humbled, will
be in better condition in every way to
fight the United States than it would
have been before the war broke out,”
is worthy of careful consideration. Of
course Mr. Maxim means any one of
the great powers, but we should be in
danger, if in danger at all, from no more
than three. These would be Great
Britain, Japan, and Germany, as these
are the only powers that possess navies
strong enough to carry on operations
across the seas against the United States,
even in our present condition of unpreparedness.
And no one of these could afford
to attack us unless the others would
give tacit consent, or agree to remain
neutral. Perhaps after the war is over,
however it may end, the European peoples
would be so weary of war that they
would not permit their governments to
stand in the way of any nation that might
want to attack this country, and hence
that we should have to rely entirely
upon our own strength for defense. The
question of how much naval and military
preparation we should make against
future contingencies is a vital one and
cannot be ignored. Everybody is in
favor of peace. The question is, which
is the surest way to peace?—unorganized
helplessness, or organized strength?</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>THE COMPOSITION OF THE WORLD COURT</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY</div>
    <div>EMERSON McMILLIN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>“Barbarians in ancient
times settled their differences
with whatever tools came
ready to hand. Cultured,
refined, and scientific pagans
to-day do nothing more, nothing less.
Must this continue for all time? Yesterday,
hundreds were pleading for saner
methods; to-day, thousands plead; to-morrow,
millions will demand a better way
of settling international differences. What
is wanted is some way not based on brute
force, but upon the principles of mutual
trust and good-will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Prior to the Christian era, but little
effort was made to avoid war. The
normal attitude of Rome, Greece, and of
Carthage was one of continuous preparation
for war. The Greek City-States
did, however, have an organized body empowered
to arbitrate differences between
the Hellenic peoples.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the fourteenth, fifteenth and seventeenth
centuries, serious efforts were made
to devise and establish means for the
avoidance of war, but success crowned
none of the efforts.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was after the Jay Treaty between
Great Britain and the United States that
the settling of international questions by
arbitration came into vogue. The many
cases successfully and satisfactorily settled
between the two Anglo-Saxon nations
have doubtless had their influence for
good upon other races and states.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding the great advance
made by the partial adoption of arbitration,
as a mode of settling international
controversies—wise men feel that another
step forward should be taken
through the establishment of a Court of
Justice, a body which will ascertain facts
and apply rules of law instead of resorting
to negotiation or expediency in the
familiar manner of Courts of Arbitration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The growth of this desire is manifested
in the records of the two Hague Conferences.
In 1899 it was but necessary to
suggest the creation of a World Court to
have it promptly put aside as impracticable.
After a lapse of but eight years the
1907 Conference adopted the following:
“The Conference recommends to the signatory
powers the adoption of the project
hereunto annexed of a Convention for the
establishment of a Court of Arbitral
Justice and its putting in effect, as soon as
an accord shall be reached upon the
choice of the Judges and the Constitution
of the Court.” This received the unanimous
support of all the Conferees.</p>

<p class='c008'>The happy result obtained is largely
attributed to the work of the American
delegation in its effort to carry out the instruction
of Secretary of State, Elihu
Root, which instruction reads as follows:
“It should be your great effort to bring
about in the second Hague Conference a
development of the Hague Tribunal into a
permanent tribunal, composed of judges,
who are judicial officers and nothing else,
and who will devote their entire time to
the trial and decision of international
causes by judicial methods and under a
sense of judicial responsibility.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The 1907 Hague Conference declared
that “International Arbitration has for
its object the settlement of disputes between
states by judges of their own
choice, and on the basis of respect for
law.” That mode of obtaining the personnel
of an Arbitration Court may be
eminently proper, as “Arbitrators only
too often act as negotiators and not as
judges, trying a cause on its merits.” But
causes that are justiciable should not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>tried before a body of judges, especially
chosen by the litigants.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the rules and constitutions
agreed upon in the Hague Convention,
there is no stipulation as to the number of
signatories required, or of states that shall
adhere, in order to make the plan available.</p>

<p class='c008'>To-day, under that Convention, any
number of the participants, who may find
themselves in accord as to the number of
judges to be chosen and the manner of
their selection, may complete the unfinished
work of the Conference by
establishing a workable Court at The
Hague. While the Hague Conference
failed to agree upon the number of Judges
that should constitute the International
Court—yet fifteen appeared to be the
favorite number in the minds of the
Conferees.</p>

<p class='c008'>The difficulties encountered by the Conference
in attempting to constitute a
Court were great. Many plans were submitted.
The delegation from our own
country presented no less than ten distinct
plans, any one of which the delegation
would have supported rather than
have the Conference fail in completing the
establishing of a Court.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the plans submitted to the Conference
provided that each state should
name one judge. This would have made
an unwieldy body—“a judicial convention
instead of a judicial court,” as was
suggested by an American delegate. Another
plan submitted provided that each
state should designate an elector from the
permanent court of arbitration, and that
these forty-five electors should select
fifteen judges, to constitute the court.
This seems fair, and there can be but little
doubt that a court so chosen would have
been a competent body. Article XV of
the Convention establishing the International
Prize Court, provides, that each
of the eight nations, generally known as
the world powers, shall always be represented,
or in the language of the Convention,
“are always summoned to sit.”
While Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy,
Russia, France, Great Britain, United
States and Japan are the great world
powers, they are not the eight powers with
the largest commerce. Belgium exceeds
three and the Netherlands exceed four of
the world powers in their respective
aggregates of commerce. The majority
of questions or controversies brought
before a judicial court will doubtless arise
through commercial channels.</p>

<p class='c008'>The experience of the United States
may be cited as an encouragement for
small states to trust the other and more
powerful states and to join with them in
the selection of fifteen judges. The
sections or states from which members of
the United States Supreme Court are
appointed seem to be a matter of absolute
indifference to the American public.
Forty-eight states represented by nine
judges. Each of these forty-eight states
is about as near a sovereign entity as are
many of the states represented in the
Hague Conference.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is confidently believed that the
several nations would strive with each
other to give to an International Court
their best men. This would be especially
true of those states, whose limited population
and restricted commerce would not
alone entitle them to a national on the
bench.</p>

<p class='c008'>The necessity for an International Court
is so obvious that it need not be discussed.
The delegates of forty-five states would
not have supported it at The Hague Conference,
if there had not been a great
desire, and a growing demand for it. The
decisions of the Court in causes brought
before it will not exhaust all its usefulness.
The laws which largely govern the Anglo-Saxon
race have grown out of customs
sanctioned by Judicial decisions. It may
be surmised that not a generation will
have passed after the inauguration of an
International Court, before International
Law will have assumed a stability to
which it has not hitherto attained. If, at
some future Hague Conference, a convention
shall be voted prohibiting belligerents
from committing—in reprisal—acts which
are otherwise prohibited by international
agreement, it will be a long step forward,
and will remove a pretext for the violation
of international law. At present, almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>any wrong may be legally committed
by belligerents under the pretext of reprisal.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the civilized world should desire
the Court, and that the delegates from all
the nations at an International Conference
should unanimously support the
effort to create the Court—are encouragements
for us all to believe that a plan can
be evolved that will meet the emergency
temporarily, even if far from perfection.
Quoting, in substance, a remark of a great
statesman, “Even if one’s hopes may not
be realized at once, that is no reason why
we should not press forward in the direction
in which we see possible success.
What is impossible to-day may become
possible to-morrow.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c012'>THE MINIMUM NUMBER<br> <span class='large'>OF NATIONS REQUIRED TO SUCCESSFULLY INAUGURATE A COURT OF ARBITRAL JUSTICE</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY</div>
    <div>HARRY A. GARFIELD</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>The proposed Court of Arbitral
Justice, is one which
deals with rules of right existing
or to be hereafter set
up between sovereign nations.
It is distinguished from the so-called
“Permanent Court of Arbitration” established
at the first Hague Conference
in 1899, in this, that it is a true court,
while the Court of Arbitration is a representative
body of negotiators selected
to settle questions largely political.
Neither by its composition nor tenure is
the Court of Arbitration qualified to deal
with questions essentially judicial. The
distinction is less difficult for Americans
than for foreigners. The line which separates
political from judicial functions,
though by no means so clear as to be instantly
perceived, is a line which every
student of law and government in the
United States must be able to trace.
The settlement of a boundary dispute, of
trade or industrial questions, while involving
judicial questions, is usually, in
international affairs, a question essentially
or chiefly political. Questions of
this kind can be settled by resort to compromise.
On the other hand, if two nations
are agreed as to the rule of right,
that is to say, if there is in each a notion
which has become fixed in favor of a certain
course of conduct as just and of
another as unjust, any question involving
this distinction is essentially and primarily
a question for a court of justice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The International Court of Prize,
established by the second Hague Conference,
fulfils still another function. It
is a war court, as its title indicates, and
has no jurisdiction over controversies
arising in times of peace. The Court of
Arbitral Justice, now under consideration,
while it may be called upon to deal with
disputes arising out of war, is primarily
intended to decide questions of law founded
in justice in such manner and at such
time as to prevent war. It is to be noted
furthermore that the object is not merely
to settle an issue temporarily. Temporary
settlements are compromises and can
be reached by resort to the Court of
Arbitration. Questions of law must be so
disposed of that each of the contending
parties will immediately or in the long
run assent to the basis of the settlement,
not merely because it is according to law
but because by common acceptation it is
believed to be just. In other words, the
chief function of the proposed court will
be to guide and direct the hearts as well
as the minds of men toward the eradication
of those deep seated causes of
difference which have plunged nations into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>war. In defending the method of
balancing the departments of government
set up in our constitution, Hamilton
pointed out a truth which has become
fundamental to the American student of
Political Science. His observation is
applicable to international affairs. “Justice,”
says Hamilton, “is the end of
government; it is the end of society; it
ever has been and ever will be pursued
until it be obtained or until liberty be
lost in the pursuit. In a society under
the forms of which the stronger faction
can readily unite and oppress the weaker,
anarchy can as truly be said to reign as
in a state of nature where the weaker
individual is not secured against the violence
of the stronger.” (Federalist 51).</p>

<p class='c008'>One of my associates has described
wars growing out of deep-seated differences
between nations as earthquake
wars. I like the expression, for it conveys
to the mind the inevitable result
accompanying fundamental differences
which, boiling up within, crack the surface
of our good intentions. The ultimate
object of the establishment of a Court of
Arbitral Justice is to prevent these abysmal
disturbances which, if allowed to
exist, will sooner or later destroy any
institution, political or judicial, set up
by the nations. The immediate object
is to come to a common understanding
of international justice, and to formulate
rules for the conduct of nations based on
that understanding.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this point a difference appears
which apparently contributed largely to
the defeat of the Article of the first convention
of the second Hague Conference,
under which, had it been adopted, the
Court of Arbitral Justice would quickly
have come into existence. The relation of
the judicial to the other departments of
government under our constitutional system
is radically different from that with
which other nations are familiar. While
there has of late been much agitation of
the question whether the Supreme Court
of the United States ought to be permitted
to overrule the will of the people expressed
through legislative bodies, it is nevertheless
fundamental to our system that the
Supreme Court stands above the legislative
and the executive when a constitutional
question is at issue. We have deliberately
and wisely set over our institutions
of government this great tribunal which
protects the individual, whether the weakest
human being or the latest artificial
person created under the law. When the
question of the composition of the Court
of Arbitral Justice was under discussion
at the Hague in 1907, M. Barboso of
Brazil brought in a proposal providing
for the equal representation of the 46
nations in the composition of the Court,
dividing the whole body into three groups
to serve for a period of three years each
in the total of nine for which they should
be chosen. This proposal was afterward
withdrawn by its author, but the
Significance of the suggestion lies in this,
that the delegates from Brazil conceived
of the Court as a body of representatives
of the several powers. As has been frequently
pointed out, such a body would
be a judicial assembly, not a judicial
court, better calculated to frame codes
than to weigh legal principles. But the
fact was that M. Barbosa did not believe
in the plan of an International Supreme
Court. To his mind and to the minds of
all of those who oppose the American conception
of the relation between the legal
and political arms of government, such
a court of justice would subordinate
sovereignty. Such a court to their minds
is inconsistent, as Mr. Scott has pointed
out (Hague Conferences, vol. <span class='fss'>I</span>, pp. 458–9),
with the sovereignty of nations. At first
sight, there appears to be little reason
why the method agreed upon for the constitution
of the International Prize Court
should not be applied to the selection of
judges for the Court of Justice. A little
reflection, however, reveals an important
difference. As already pointed out, the
Prize Court is organized to settle international
questions arising out of war.
There is little objection, therefore, to the
arrangement for rotation in office of the
judges. When, however, as in the
case of the proposed Court, there is set
up a body which is given jurisdiction
over questions of international rights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>with powers like those of a common law
court to evolve by the cumulation of their
decisions new rules of international law,
it is easy to perceive why all the powers
represented at the Hague agreed that
the judges sitting in this court must possess
the highest qualities of judicial mind
and learning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Enough has been said by way of introduction,
to lead up to the main question,
the minimum number of nations required
to successfully inaugurate the court.
Mr. Thomas Raeburn White, speaking
at the third national conference of the
American Society for Judicial Settlement
of International Disputes, in December,
1912, analyzed the articles of the convention
providing for the establishment of
the court and showed that the question
was clearly left to the powers represented
at the conference and could be adopted
by any two or more of them when they
saw fit. There appears to be no serious
dissent from this proposition. Therefore,
the question is not whether two nations
may of right inaugurate the court, but
whether two nations can successfully set
it up. What is meant by successfully?
Undoubtedly this: that, when the court
is set up by two or more nations, it will
be resorted to not only by the nations
inaugurating it, but by others for the
settlement of those great questions of
international right which the framers of
the convention had in mind when formulating
the organic act.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our able and far-seeing Secretary of
State, Elihu Root, in issuing instructions
to the delegates of the second Hague
Conference, set before them a distinction
which I believe ought never to be lost
sight of in providing for the establishment
of this court. He said in substance that
the court should be composed of judges
representing the several great juridical
systems of the world. What this court
must undertake to do, if it is to lead men
and nations to accept a common standard
of international right, is to reconcile whatever
differences now exist in the minds of
men, concerning the essentials of justice.
If men living under one system regard
conduct as just which men living under
another system think unjust, it is obvious
that these differences must be
reconciled. Hence, the success of the
court will be more nearly assured if it is
inaugurated by two nations of opposite
juridical experiences and concepts than
if inaugurated by several times that number,
all bred under a single system. The
nations represented at the Hague Conference
all draw their juridical systems
from one of two sources, the Civil Law
of Rome or the Common Law of England.
Among the large number deriving their
systems from Roman origin, there are
many and important shades of difference,
and in some of the nations which in recent
years have reorganized their codes both
sources are drawn upon. Nevertheless
there is generally speaking, this difference
of origin to take into account.
Among the eight Great Powers above
named, the British Empire and the United
States are the Common Law nations.
The other six are inheritors of the Roman
system. In a general way, these six fall
into three groups, Germany and Austria
in one, France and Italy in another, and
Japan and Russia in still a third, unless
the last two should be treated separately.
It seems to me that the inclusion of representatives
of the different juridical systems
is so important that it becomes
determinative. I should therefore say,
the court can be successfully inaugurated
by four of the Great Powers, provided
the four include one nation of each of the
following groups:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>Great Britain and the United States;
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>France and Italy;
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>Germany and Austria-Hungary; and
    </dd>
    <dt>4.</dt>
    <dd>Japan and Russia.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c022'>The court might succeed if the United
States and one of the Great Powers of
the Continent set it up, but in that case
the success would consist in merely making
a beginning, in keeping the court alive
until others should join in its maintenance,
whereas, with four nations uniting
as above proposed, with the opportunity
open to others to come in, a strong beginning
would be made—in other words, the
proposed court could be successfully
inaugurated.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h2 class='c012'>THE BREAKDOWN OF “CULTURE” AS A REDEMPTIVE FORCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>All thinking and serious people
must, in the past year, spontaneously
have reflected upon the
shocking incongruity of the most cultured
nations of the earth—Germany,
France, England, Italy, and in many
respects, Russia and Japan—being engaged
in a warfare which has no parallel
in all of humanity’s previous pages.
Hitherto we have been assured that culture,
science, literature, art, music, the
drama, invention, discovery, technical
advance, governmental efficiency, social
reform, and all that belongs to the educative
phases of man’s progress, constituted
all the gospel we needed, and could
be relied upon in any event as the mainstay
of civilization and the true inspiration
of man’s upward and onward course
to higher and still higher degrees of attainment.
Those who held otherwise
and contended that these were not sufficient,
but that religion and the ethical
teachings of the Bible must ever be the
incentive of the world’s substantial growth
in depth of character, were looked upon
in many quarters as somewhat narrow
sectarians, or perhaps regarded superciliously
as uncultivated fanatics.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the failure of culture and mere intellectualism
to secure man’s salvation
is so evident and appalling in the light of
what is happening on the blood-soaked
soil of Europe, that the contention of the
Secularists has received an answer which
is indisputable and conclusive. Culture
and education, admittedly the noblest
products of man’s endeavor, have fallen
disastrously short of the promises made
in their behalf. The neglect of religion,
the decay of a vital faith, have resulted in
an awful catastrophe. To him who runs
and reads the signs of our times, the
proclamation of the prophets of religion
and the ministers of Christ have proved
themselves so true as to need no further
substantiation. Trust in Jehovah and
reliance upon the Redeemer of the world
for salvation from sin and the sanctification
of the human heart, have once
more demonstrated their own absolute
necessity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The end of all education—of all development
in the name and line of culture—ought
to lie in the strengthening
of character. Of what use are all material
achievements if only a dismal emptiness
is bound up within? Of what profit
is it, says one, whether our railroad trains
run sixty miles an hour, if men are fools
when they enter, and fools still when
they leave? Of what significance is the
wonder of wireless telegraphy, if the electric
flashes through the ether convey only
the accounts of commercial frauds, the
follies of the rich, the discontent of the
poor, social intrigues, and political scandals?
Why should we educate our youth
if, in the end, they have learned only to
lie more plausibly or forge more cleverly?
Caliban’s caustic observation was that
the only profit he had secured from being
taught his master’s language was that
he now knew how to curse. A cultivated
scoundrel may do more harm with
a stroke of his pen than a score of rude
burglars can accomplish in twelve months.
A superficial education, divorced from
religion, may be handmade to villainy’s
more effectual service.</p>

<p class='c008'>Said Huxley once, “Clever men are as
common as blackberries; the rare thing
is to find a good man.” This chord was
struck strongly by Kipling in his “Recessional:”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Still stands thine ancient sacrifice,</div>
      <div class='line'>An humble and a contrite heart:</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord, God of Hosts, be with us yet</div>
      <div class='line'>Lest we forget, lest we forget!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Well did Milton exhort those of his own
people in these words: “Let not England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>forget her precedent in teaching nations
how to live.” If the homely and commonplace
virtues are allowed to die out
in vanities and self-indulgences; if the
qualities of self-respect and righteousness,
so necessary to our national perpetuity,
shall decay through neglect, no amount
of mere material prosperity can ever
make amends for the disaster.</p>

<p class='c008'>The world owes a great debt of gratitude
without question to Greece and its
prophets of the intellect—those who have
stood forth through all the generations
since as the authorities in philosophy,
physics, art, architecture, sculpture, oratory,
and politics. Such names as Thales,
Pythagoras, Democritus, Socrates, Plato,
Aristotle, Pheidias, Praxiteles, Archimedes,
Thucydides, Pericles will always
shine as stars of the first magnitude in
the intellectual heavens. But salvation
was not of the Greeks, but “of the
Jews.” When we turn to the pages of the
Psalmist, the Prophets, and the Evangelists,
we scarcely shall find a word about
philosophy, geometry, music, painting,
the science of politics, or the construction,
constitution, movements, and mysteries
of the physical universe. But Isaiah,
Micah, Amos, the Gospel writers, and
Saint Paul—and, infinitely above all, the
Carpenter Prophet of Nazareth—have
given the world the loftiest and most absolutely
necessary rules and ideals of living.
Cleverness is evermore inferior to
goodness. Let a man have no matter
what completeness of education, the
ultimate question remains, “How is he
going to use it?” And this query must
be answered by something beyond the
mental development itself. The Devil
is accredited with having a first-class
mind and a brilliant understanding. A
man bearing all the university degrees,
if not chastened and restrained by the
spirit of a living religious faith, may
prove more of a curse than of a blessing
to his fellows. The mention of such
personalities as Alexander VI, Macchiavelli,
Napoleon, and Byron is enough to
support the claim we are making. There
has never been a great revival of religion
which did not result in a corresponding
turning away from frivolity and vice to a
soulful seriousness and nobler form of
life. The ages of faith have also been, as
proved by the careers of John Knox, the
Puritans, and John Wesley, the ages of
national greatness.</p>

<p class='c019'>Well did Tennyson pray, in lines oft
quoted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let knowledge grow from more to more,</div>

      <div class='line'>Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.”</div>

  <h2 class='c012'>THE CHURCH AS A FACTOR IN RACIAL RELATIONS</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY</div>
    <div>REV. SIDNEY L. GULICK</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>The human race is entering
upon a new era of development.
Space has practically
collapsed bringing into immediate
relations races and
civilizations that have come into being
through milleniums of divergent evolution.
The impact of Christendom on
Asia has at last started into new activity
those long torpid peoples comprising
more than one-half of the human race.
Asia is awaking, is learning: she is acquiring
our modes of thought and life and
organization.</p>

<p class='c008'>These two facts, the collapse of space
and the awakening of Asia are creating
a new world-situation. To adapt herself
to the conditions created for her by the
West, the East has found herself forced
to abandon her isolation and to reorganize
the entire scheme of life and thought
which she has been developing for not less
than four thousand years.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Asia’s awakening and acquisition
of Western modes of political, industrial,
commercial and intellectual life, and particularly
her development of military
power, and national ambitions, and her
insistence on national rights, are creating
a new world-situation for Western lands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Twenty-six years of life in Japan have
colored my brain with the Orient. It is
widely assumed that the white race is,
and is to remain dominant, the supreme
factor in the world’s history; and that our
primary problem is concerned with the
establishment of such arrangements between
the white nations as will produce
peace here. We little realize, however,
the mighty significance of the new factors
that are coming into our lives because of
the rise of other parts of the human race.</p>

<p class='c008'>The white man little appreciates the
Asiatic. He suspects, dislikes, scorns,
despises him, and is not willing to treat
him on the basis of equality, justice and
courtesy. To this day even in this
Christian land, we are not dealing justly
with the alien, especially the alien from
Asia. And this is creating a serious
situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the Church has been an important
factor in creating the new world-situation.
Through its missionary activity,
entirely devoid of desires for territorial
aggression, the Church has sent into every
nation men without a particle of racial
ambition. They have become friends of
individuals of other races; they have come
to understand those lands and their peoples
and these in turn have come to understand,
trust, and love the missionaries.
In these ways there have been imparted
to Japan and China ideals, conceptions,
and ambitions which are proving to be
mighty forces in those lands. Japan would
not be what she is to-day had it not been
for those early missionaries who went to
that land in the sixties and seventies. The
few young men who were taught by them
in Western ways became the leaders of
Japan; they saw and helped their fellow-countrymen
to see that Japan must learn
what the West had to teach her. Japan
humbled her proud head. In the last
forty years she has employed more than
five thousand white men to come to her
land to teach, and no one can tell how
many thousand of her young men have
traveled and studied in foreign lands, and
returned with treasures inestimable. In
a single generation Japan has taken her
place as one of the leading nations.</p>

<p class='c008'>One thing I would like to impress upon
peace workers, is this: Japan is tired of
having peace lecturers come to tell her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>about the horrors of war and the importance
of peace. What Japan asks is justice.
If we do not give her justice she
cares nothing for peace. Peace lecturers,
as a rule, little realize that Japan
is no longer a child. She is pretty well
grown up, and is better acquainted as
a whole with the political conditions of
the world than any other nation. She
has sent her young men into every nation
and they have returned speaking the
languages of all the civilized peoples of
the world. They can read the newspapers
of every land and know what is going on.
The news of the world is better presented
in the newspapers of Japan than it is
in the majority of our papers in this country.
Japan is no longer a child. She
understands the world situation and
realizes it.</p>

<p class='c008'>But because Japan is Asiatic, we suspect
and fear her; we even get hysterical
about her. Once when the anti-alien
legislation of California was the cause of
international tension one of our Generals
is reported to have asked for four hundred
and fifty thousand troops with which to
patrol the Pacific coast, fearing an attack
from Japan. This reveals an extraordinary
misunderstanding. Japan desires
friendship with America and will do anything
consistent with national dignity
and honor to maintain friendship. During
the last five years she has consistently
carried out the so-called Gentlemen’s
Agreement because of which there are
some seven thousand less Japanese in
America to-day than there were when
the arrangement went into operation.
California, however, ignoring that fact,
went ahead with invidious race-discriminating
legislation. Japan does not want
any more preachers of peace. She wants
preachers of justice.</p>

<p class='c008'>For sixty years now we have had relations
with Japan and they have been remarkably
friendly. To-day we have
China’s unqualified friendship. We returned
a few years ago to China the
Boxer indemnity; in the seventies, we
returned the Shimonoseki indemnity to
Japan. These splendid acts have been
highly appreciated. But do you realize
that we are losing Japan’s friendship and
in turn will surely lose that of China, because
we are not keeping our treaty
pledges? Do you realize that we are
continuously subjecting the Chinese in
our land to indignities that deeply wound
their feelings? We are confronting a
serious situation, serious because we are
so ignorant and so indifferent.</p>

<p class='c008'>So much in regard to the problems.
Turning now to the solution. Ought not
the Church to be a main factor in solving
the problems of the new era in race relations?
It should teach us with new insistence
that God is no respecter of races;
all alike are His children and beloved
by Him. It is so easy for a people to
think of themselves as God’s pet child,
even as the Jews thought of themselves
as the elect race. We white people regard
ourselves as inherently superior to all
others. We are, however, profoundly
ignorant of the Asiatic and therefore we
scorn and despise him. We easily fancy
that a gulf divides us.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is indeed a difference between
us, but it is not such a difference as is
generally assumed, nor is it insuperable.
My life in Japan has brought me into such
relationship with Japanese that I am perfectly
clear on this point. To talk about
an insuperable obstacle, a profound gulf
that separates the East from the West
is the result of insufficient experience.
One of the important things, therefore,
which the Church can do and is doing
through its thousands of foreign missionaries
is to gain wide and real knowledge
of the East as it has been and as it
now is, and then to impart that knowledge
to the nations of the West.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second great thing which the
Church can and should do is to insist that
our laws shall be so framed and administered
as to do justice to Asiatics in this
land. Until we do that, can we claim
that ours is a Christian land? As a matter
of fact, we do not grant the Asiatic
a square deal in this country nor give
them an open door; yet we demand them
for ourselves over there. We do not even
give them the courtesy which we secure.
The Asiatic is more sensitive to slight or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>insult than we are. We are thick-skinned.
In their civilization courtesy is a highly
important element. But we go on in
our blunt ways wounding their feelings,
and even disregarding their rights. Is
it not time for our churches to insist
that our laws shall be so modified,
framed, and administered as to do
them justice and to deal with them
courteously?</p>

<p class='c008'>The Church is facing a new testing
time and a new time of opportunity with
regard to the relation of the races. The
first great testing time of the churches
occurred immediately after Pentecost
when Jewish Christians thought that
Gentiles had to become Jews before they
could be Christians and brothers. But
the Holy Spirit led them to see that all
men are brothers, without becoming Jews,
and those early Christians learned even
to eat with Samaritans and with Gentiles;
they welcomed them into their
brotherhood. <i>Now</i> it is the white man
who feels that he is the elect race and
has special hold upon the grace of
God; he looks down upon other races as
inferior. But God is teaching us our
error. The Asiatic is indeed our equal.
I would just as soon sit at the feet of
competent Japanese professors as I would
at the feet of professors of German or
American extraction. We are discovering
that Asiatics are as brainy as we are;
and that they produce men of splendid
character. But it is a question to-day
whether and how far our churches are
willing to accept the fact that men of
other races and colors and even with almond
eyes, are our equals. This is a new
testing time for the churches and also a
time of rare opportunity.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF A WORLD COURT</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY</div>
    <div>WILLIAM DUDLEY FOULKE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>In considering the possibilities
and limitations of a world tribunal
an American naturally turns his eyes
to the experience of his own country
especially to the development of the
Supreme Court of the United States.
The history of the development of
our National Constitution and judiciary
out of the mere league organized by
Articles of Confederation, foreshadows
in its general features the course which
mankind is likely to take in organizing
some coming federation of the United
States of Europe or of the world. For
the balance-of-power statesmanship which
has prevailed since the middle ages lead
to a condition of very unstable equilibrium
which can not and will not continue
forever. The civilized world was a great
empire once and it will be at some period
hereafter either a great empire, with
nationalities subjugated or extinguished
or else a great federation with nationalities
recognized for local and national
purposes, but subject to one general control
for international purposes. The
gradual union of mankind in larger and
larger units, first the family, then the clan,
the tribe, the city, the nation and finally
the empire or the great federated republic
will have its final completion in a world
empire or a world federation. That will
be the only way in which war will ever
become extinct and the history of our own
confederation and our subsequent federal
union is pointing out the method in which
this world union can best be established.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course we realize that such a change
cannot take place at once. Very few
stones in this gigantic structure can be
laid at one time. Many harvests will
ripen and the snows of many winters will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>cover the earth before the majestic fabric
of a world state shall lift its dome to heaven.
But the foundation courses have
already been laid in the Hague Conferences
and the panel of judges; and the one
thing most practicable to-day to further
the building of this tremendous edifice
is the establishment of a permanent
World Court. By making this the next
stage of development we pursue indeed,
not the precise course adopted in the making
of our Federal Constitution, but we
follow the line of least resistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is evident that the jurisdiction of the
World Court at the beginning will be
less extensive than that of our Supreme
Court to-day. It ought perhaps to include
at first only one thing, controversies
between nations, and only such controversies
as may properly be submitted to a
court—only justiciable questions. But
what are justiciable questions? They
have been defined as questions of law or
fact relating to the interpretation of a
treaty or the obligations of international
law. But this definition is most elastic.
International jurisprudence is yet in a
rudimentary condition and its principles,
many of them, are yet undetermined.
No one knows yet just how far they may
be extended by the construction of a
World Court. When Austria began war
against Servia, was that a breach of international
law? When Russia determined to
come to the aid of a kindred people whom
she had taken under her protection and
then mobilized for the invasion of Austria,
was that a breach of international law?
Perhaps most jurists will say, no, these
were political questions to be handled by
a Council of Conciliation or some other
body. Yet all this depends upon construction
and upon the determination of
what international law really requires.
Is not the invasion of the territory of a
friendly nation which has given the invader
no direct provocation, a breach of
international law? Who shall decide?
If this question, too, be left to the proposed
World Court, that body may decide that
anything is justiciable and may assume
jurisdiction over questions of vital national
policy. Will the great nations of
the world agree to that? Will they submit
what they consider their most vital
interests to any tribunal?</p>

<p class='c008'>And now we come to the much disputed
question whether nations should agree
to refer questions affecting their honor
and vital interests to an international
tribunal. Here we are in this dilemma.
If a treaty agreeing to submit disputes to
a court, should exclude all questions of
honor and vital interests then almost any
question may be considered a question
of honor or vital interest at the will of
the nation so desiring and the treaty will
mean very little. On the other hand, if
questions of honor and vital interest are
included in the things to be submitted,
then if a real vital interest is affected,
the probabilities are very strong that the
decree of the court will not be acquiesced
in by the losing party. Germany considered
that her vital interests demanded
a passage through Belgium into France
so the treaty became a “scrap of paper.”
America thinks that her vital interests
require that no new aggressive military
foreign power shall obtain a foot-hold
close to our boundaries on our own continent.
We feel that our national security
requires this. Would we consent to submit
this question to a World Court?
International law would allow Denmark
to sell St. Thomas to Germany or Colombia
to sell a strip of land adjacent to
Panama for military and naval purposes.
International law would allow Mexico to
sell Lower California with Magdalena
Bay to Japan. A World Court would
decide they had the right to do it. Suppose
the sale were made and a German or
Japanese navy with transports and an
army came to take possession, would we
submit this question to a World Court?
Would we even delay our defense long
enough to refer to a Council of Conciliation
with the months or years which
must elapse before decision during which
time the foreign power would go on
taking possession, fortifying and garrisoning
a naval and military base right
at our very doors? Such a position reminds
me of the stanza once quoted
in Parliament:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“I hear a lion in the lobby roar;</div>
      <div class='line'>Say, Mr. Speaker, shall we shut the door</div>
      <div class='line'>And keep him out, or shall we let him in</div>
      <div class='line'>And see if we can get him out again?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>No nation will submit a really vital question
involving its national life to a World
Court and then keep the agreement if the
decision is adverse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Is it not then evident that the agreement
of submission must itself provide
exactly what vital questions shall be excluded?
In other words, that the signatory
powers (according to the suggestion
made by Mr. Roosevelt) “shall by solemn
covenant agree as to their respective
rights which shall not be questioned;
that they shall agree that all other questions
arising between them shall be submitted
to a court.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This agreement would provide that the
territory of the contracting powers
should be inviolate and that it should be
guaranteed absolutely its sovereign rights
in certain other particulars including for
instance the right to decide the terms on
which immigrants should be admitted;
to regulate its domestic affairs in its own
way and such other questions as the contracting
powers considered affected their
vital interests or the vital interests of any
of them. These specified questions ought
not to be submitted to the court; they
ought to be mutually guaranteed in advance
and all matters not so specified
should be subject to the jurisdiction of
the international tribunal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here you have the jurisdiction of the
court definitely laid down in the treaty
creating it. Wider jurisdiction can afterward
be conferred as circumstances may
justify, it is to be hoped that other
Hague Conferences may gradually provide
a more and more extended code of international
law which the court is to administer
and that its jurisdiction may finally
extend to all the other principal questions
which are now submitted to our federal
tribunals under our own constitution.
But this more extensive jurisdiction would
be granted (as in the case of our own Constitution)
only after the federation becomes
a more perfect union, and when
there shall be established a sufficient
sanction of its decrees.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now we come to the most important
and the most difficult branch of the
subject. How can the decrees of an
international court be enforced? By
public opinion? By agreements of the
signatory powers? Or by an international
police-force which of course means an
international army controlled by an
international executive?</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of us used to hope that international
public opinion, while quite insufficient
to-day to enforce the judgment
of a World Court, might gradually grow
to such strength and power that it could
finally be counted on alone to give force
to the decisions of this tribunal. The
events of the present war have shattered
to a great extent such hopes as these.
After the invasions of Belgium and Luxembourg,
the wrecking of Louvain, the attack
on helpless Scarborough, the dropping
of bombs from the air on undefended
towns, the destruction of the <i>Lusitania</i>,
the coercion of unoffending China, it is
hard to say that public opinion will restrain
a military power from any act
whatever or will compel the performance
of any duty to other nations or to mankind
at large. If the world had advanced
so little in the nineteen hundred years of
Christianity, how long will it take in
the future to induce all the great nations
to do justice?</p>

<p class='c008'>The next alternative is that the power
creating this court shall agree beforehand
to enforce its decrees by the joint use of
their military forces against any nation
which may refuse compliance. That is
probably as far as the world can go to-day
and yet how ineffective it may be is shown
both by the past experience of the American
Confederation and by the failure to
observe the Hague convention and other
existing treaties during the present war.
Such an agreement will have the same
defect as the Articles of Confederation.
It can only act upon nations in their corporate
capacity and not upon individuals,
and there will be no central authority
with either purse or sword by which to
carry out its guarantees. It will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>necessarily a transitory state. The treaties
signed by the great powers did not
protect Belgium. The Hague Convention
to which every great nation was a signatory
has been violated in many particulars.
Our nation was a signatory to the
Hague tribunal yet all these violations
have not aroused us to a single act for
the maintenance of the Hague Convention,
nay, they did not bring out a single
protest or remonstrance until our own
interests or the persons or property of
our citizens became involved. How far
then can we trust other nations to protect
each other against violations of their
mutual agreements? As in the case of
the single states in the American Confederation,
some will do it and some will not.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet what better can we do to-day? If
the nations joining the league would be
willing now to establish an international
executive council with power to enforce
such agreements and to raise an international
army for that purpose we would
be taking a long step toward a really
efficient union. But at this moment the
composition of such an executive council
would be beset by very great difficulties.
Even if that question could be settled,
how many nations to-day would be willing
to surrender any part of their ultimate
sovereignty to a federal union? Is it
not evident that the world is no more ripe
for such a union now than the thirteen
colonies were ripe for our own federal
constitution, while they were still carrying
on the War of Independence?</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was during that war that our first
league of American states was formed—imperfect
and inadequate—but a precursor
of better things. It was at the
outbreak of the present war that an alliance
was made among a number of the
great powers. It is at the conclusion of
this war that we may hope for a league
among many of the most powerful nations
for the maintenance of peace;—a league,
imperfect and rudimentary at the beginning
but which may well develop, when
its imperfections have been realized and
the necessity of a “more perfect union,”
becomes clear into a world wide confederacy,
which shall have a full dominion
over the nations that compose it as our
federal union now has over the states of
the American republic.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even then the whole work will not
be done, insurrections and rebellions,
like our own civil war, may be required
to consolidate that union more and more
firmly before the time shall come when
nations shall not take up arms against
nation, neither shall they learn war any
more.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>THE BUSINESS MAN IN POLITICS</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY</div>
    <div>JOHN HAYS HAMMOND</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>In our last Congress, out of ninety-six
members of the Senate and four
hundred and thirty-five members of
the House of Representatives, only
about seventy legislators were classified
as business men. This means
that the Congress of the United States
cannot be regarded as a genuinely representative
body. To make it such, we
should have a much larger representation
than we have of the business class in the
broadest sense of the term,—that is, not
only manufacturers, merchants, and bankers,
but also farmers, engineers, leaders of
labor organizations, scientific men, journalists,
physicians, educators, and men of
other vocations influential in the life of
the Nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>This conception of the proper make-up
of our legislative bodies is a comparatively
new and unfamiliar one, partly because it
has been felt that legal training and practice
in applying the laws in courts made
men particularly fitted to be law-makers
and partly because until recently decidedly
few business men have attracted public
attention by reason of their knowledge
and skill in handling questions of government.
The old idea of the statesman was
that he ought to be detached from the
active every-day interests of the community
and thus be in a position to
give his attention to general matters of
public and national policy. The present
generation, however, has been coming to
realize that most of these matters are
directly or indirectly related to the business
of the citizens of the country and
that the wise determination of them involves
taking into account the principles
and the necessary practices of business.
Hence the subject of the place of the
business man in politics is becoming one
of compelling interest, not only because
of patriotic considerations, but also on
account of the enlightened self-interest
which should serve as a guide in legislation
for the benefit of the country as a whole,
as well as of the individuals who are its
citizens.</p>

<p class='c008'>For his comparatively small representation
in legislative halls the business man
himself is largely to blame. There has
been a lamentable lack of interest on the
part of American business men as a class
in our country’s political affairs. By
many of them politics has been regarded
as having merely an academic interest,
so far as they were concerned; by others
politics has been held to be an unclean
vocation. In a way, however, these allegations
about the character of politics
have been only convenient excuses for
failure to take a proper part in public
affairs. Generally speaking, the plain,
unvarnished reason for the failure of business
men to discharge their political duties
has been their unwillingness to make the
necessary sacrifices of social pleasures,
of money or of present business opportunities.
Business men who allow such
motives to dominate their actions are
simply shirking their civic responsibilities,
are essentially disloyal to the community
from which they derive their support, and
should be so stigmatized by their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still less justifiable than the indifference
to politics which has just been described
is the habit which too many business men,
especially those controlling large corporations,
have permitted themselves to fall
into, of dealing with political and legislative
matters at second hand and by
indirection. This habit, fortunately for
the country, has of late been greatly diminishing
because of the strong condemnation
of it by enlightened public opinion;
but it cannot be denied that for many
years in our political history the owners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and managers of important corporations,
with some notable exceptions, regarded
it as justifiable, while keeping out
of politics themselves, to make generous
contributions to campaign funds and thus
to assist in electing legislators who could
be counted upon to attend to matters
of legislation affecting their interests.
Apart from its moral objections, this practice
necessarily developed a class of mere
professional politicians without any qualifications
whatsoever to deal with the
great business problems of our cities, our
States and the Nation itself. Every
thinking American must admit that a
highly beneficial result of the agitation
of the question of the relation of government
to business in the past few years has
been to bring about a vast change in this
order of things. Corporations are no
longer able to dictate legislation for their
selfish ends through a conscienceless and
morally stultified class of political representatives.
It is well that this rank
undergrowth, which impeded all proper
participation in politics on the part of
self-respecting business men, has been to
a great extent cleared away.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a growing realization on the
part of the public that our business prosperity
and our political soundness are
mutually interdependent,—that we cannot
have business prosperity without the
aid of just, adequate and far-sighted
government, and that we cannot have
permanently satisfactory public policies
without the aid of the experienced and
enlightened business class. Especially is
this truth being impressed upon the minds
of citizens of the country as they reflect
upon the conditions that will have to be
met as a result of the European War.
We have already had a chance to see how
few men in American public life are able
to cope with far-reaching international
problems, while at the same time it is
rapidly dawning upon us that our chief
political and economic problems of the
future will be of the world, and not of the
“parish pump,” type. This is bringing
home to our minds the interdependence
of all our industries and business activities,
and of all classes in the community, in
whatever vocations they may be engaged.
There can be but little doubt that as public
thinking follows these lines more and
more fully and resolutely there will be a
tendency in our future legislation, which
the demagogic politicians will be unable
to withstand, to subordinate considerations
of petty political advantage, and of
partisan aims and ends, to the right solution
of the great economic problems
which are at last seen to be vital to the
welfare of the Nation, at home and abroad.</p>

<p class='c008'>The assistance which business men can
give in the work of arriving at correct
solutions of these great economic problems
is apparent. It is also apparent that
without this assistance Congress and the
administrative departments of our Government
cannot be expected to reach correct
and adequate conclusions in regard to
them. The truth is that our Government
as a whole is at this very moment
suffering severely in efficiency and economy
from the lack of the continuous participation
of able business men in the conduct
of its affairs. The administration of our
governmental departments, for instance,
is confessedly obsolete and uneconomical,
if judged by the best business standards.
Thus, both an increase in our national revenues
and a decrease in our national expenditures
could undoubtedly be effected
through the coöperation of expert business
men in Congress with the heads of these departments
in the introduction of the most
approved business methods. In the management
of the ordinary affairs of the
country our Government had been well
likened to a great corporation in which all
the people of the country are stockholders.
This conception has not yet become
universal, but when it does—and it undoubtedly
will—there will result a general
demand for successful business men in
the administration of the People’s Corporation.</p>

<p class='c008'>This, however, will be only a part of
the demand that will arise when it is more
fully appreciated how impossible it is to
arrive at sound public policies and practices
with respect to any matter, domestic
or foreign, affecting the country, without
having due regard for the business principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>which control the means by which
almost all the material and ideal benefits
of society are procured. The larger demand
will be that the politicians cease to
look upon politics as a field reserved for
their own often purely selfish activities
and that business men as a class no longer
treat politics as having only a remote and
academic interest for them and hence as
deserving to be relegated to irresponsible
theorists or to casually selected and mainly
incompetent legislators.</p>

<p class='c008'>A new conception of the qualifications
of those who conduct our Government
is beginning to take shape in this country.
Time was when the prevalent popular
notion was that the chief qualification
required for a political career was to be
an adept in the Machiavellian arts; and
the currency of this notion has undoubtedly
deterred many a conscientious man of
tender susceptibilities from taking the
part in politics for which he was well fitted
by his business experience and in which
he could have been of great benefit to the
community. But this conception is rapidly
passing, no doubt to the intense
irritation of some of the surviving politicians
of the old school, who are having
it impressed upon them that indispensable
prerequisites to real and abiding success
in politics, as well as in business, are integrity
of purpose, straight-forwardness
in dealing with the public and an honest
intent to serve, not their own selfish
interests, but the permanent good of the
community. The old-time equivocations,
lack of candor and nefarious machinations
of the resourceful party boss
have now so little chance of success that
it is clear, even to those who are reluctant
to give them up, that they must now be
consigned to the scrap-heap of discredited
politics. And it is this very fact that
removes the most disagreeable obstacles
from the way of the able yet scrupulous
business man who feels impelled to do his
share towards making politics subserve
the best interests of the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>The consequences of the tendencies
just described are already observable
in our public life. While unfortunately
it is still true that the average character
and qualifications of our political leaders,
legislators and officeholders are by no
means of the high standard required by
the great economic and political interests
of the country, yet I do not like the muckrakers’
sweeping denunciations of our
public men as a class. I have had some
opportunity in recent years to observe
these public men, and what I have seen
of them has given me the opinion that
the majority of them are of unimpeachable
integrity and that not a few of them
possess uncommon ability. Certainly the
vast interests of the United States demand
that those intrusted with the duties
of government should have political wisdom
and business capacity of the highest
kind,—undoubtedly much higher than
we have yet attained on the average; but
nothing whatever is gained by dishonest
or even by undeserved criticism of men
in public station. Disingenuous and purely
political abuse of our legislators and public
officers serves but to belittle the critics,
to diminish the legitimate influence of the
press which prints and circulates their
diatribes, and, worse still, to deter many
desirable men from entering the public
service. Nothing could be more harmful
to the Nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this but emphasizes the fact that
the ideal we should steadily pursue
is to fill our Government, both on the
legislative and on the administrative side,
with men of the broadest practical experience
and with the highest conceptions
of the disinterested service and the honorable
fulfilment of their duties required
of them for the public good. The community
derives little advantage from the
mere gratification of the personal political
ambitions of its public men. Politics,
rightly conceived, cannot be regarded as
primarily intended to afford a field for
those whose motives, even if not illegitimate,
are characterized more by a
desire for self-advancement than by a
sense of obligation to handle the Nation’s
affairs in the soundest and most efficient
way. What is needed first of all, is
that the American people should be able
to say with absolute assurance that its
Congress and its National administrative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>departments (not to mention its State
and municipal governmental agencies)
are composed of such men that the principles
of sound, efficient, economical and
honorable business can be counted upon
to prevail in the handling of all matters,
notwithstanding all the extravagant proposals
of loose thinking or self-seeking
politicians of the lower type.</p>

<p class='c008'>The people must make up their minds
that they will have the responsible positions
in the Government, legislative or
administrative, occupied by men who
have demonstrated their ability and success
as enlightened business men. Already
in the selection of political leaders
our voters are beginning to call for men
about whose personal integrity there is
no doubt—men above the influence of the
selfish and unscrupulous corporations,
on the one hand, or the dictation of the
so-called labor vote, on the other; men
who have the courage of their convictions
and who can be relied upon to give their
support to legislative measures which
best serve the interest of the general public,
irrespective of all other considerations.
This is an enormous gain for the country.
But much more is necessary. The entire
Government and the politics that determines
what it shall be must be infused
with the spirit of sound knowledge and
aggressive efficiency which characterizes
American business of the best type. The
place of our business men in politics is to
bring this about.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>PEACE BY COMPULSION<br> <span class='large'>SOME PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE PATH OF THE OPERATION OF THE PROPOSED LEAGUE OF PEACE—IT WOULD NECESSITATE A RADICAL CHANGE OF POLICY ON THE PART OF THE UNITED STATES</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY</div>
    <div>JAMES BROWN SCOTT</div>
    <div><span class='small'>[DIRECTOR OF THE CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR UNIVERSAL PEACE]</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>In regard to the proposition to
employ force to compel international
peace, it seems to me that
the use of force cannot be safely
entrusted to any nation or group
of nations; that the United States would
not consent to grant such a right to a
power or group of powers; and that, therefore,
we should not ask that we ourselves
be allowed to use force in certain cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>One can easily think of cases in which
we would not consent to arbitrate. For
instance, if Denmark should sell St.
Thomas to Germany, or if Mexico should
make a cession of Magdalena Bay to
Japan, we would undoubtedly insist that
the cession in either case was void, as
contravening our policy, and, if the cessionaire
refused to cancel the cession, we
would prevent the occupation of the
territories in question by force. We
would not submit the question to an international
tribunal, because under international
law Denmark and Mexico would
have the right to make such cessions. We
could not or would not submit the question
to a Council of Conciliation, because
its recommendation would be against a
policy which the people of the United
States insist upon. If the foreign country
insisted upon the cession and took possession,
as it would have the legal right to
do, war might result. There are other
illustrations. I merely mention two
which have figured from time to time in
the press.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be well, however, to give a
further sample or two. Suppose that
Russia and Japan should fall out over
their rights in Manchuria, and Russia or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Japan should use force against the other.
Would the United States be willing to use
its land and naval forces against either one
or the other of these two great powers?
Or suppose that the demands which Japan
might feel justified in making upon China,
either now or during the course of the war,
or indeed after its termination, should be
of a kind which China could not accept
without sacrificing its independence, and
Japan should thereupon use force, although
China offered to submit the
question to arbitration, would the United
States, as a party to the League of Peace,
use its land and naval forces against
Japan? Or would the United States be
willing to become a party to a League
which might have pledged its good faith to
do so?</p>

<p class='c008'>And speaking of the proposed League of
Peace, I notice that its partizans do not
contemplate the use of force to compel the
execution of a judgment. Force is to be
used to get the parties into court or before
the Council of Conciliation; that is to say,
in case of a nation that refuses to submit
its case to the court or to the council and
invades the territory of the country with
which it is in controversy, the members of
the League bind themselves to unite their
forces with the other party willing to
arbitrate, and to use their forces thus combined
against the nation going to war instead
of arbitrating the dispute. If
public opinion can be depended upon to
execute the award, cannot public opinion
be depended upon to force nations into
court, if only the controversy be made
public and public opinion be given a
chance?</p>

<p class='c008'>The suggestion of a League of Peace is
very attractive in that it does not propose
any particular kind of solution, but contents
itself with the statement that the
difference, whatever it is, shall be settled
peaceably, leaving it to the parties in
dispute to determine the form and nature
of the adjustment. Some of the speakers
at the Philadelphia gathering, in referring
to the proposition of using force against a
recalcitrant nation, admitted that the
United States would need to change its
policy in order to become a party to the
League, but felt that the United States
should be willing to do so. I gather the impression
that such speakers had in mind
the use of force by the United States
against other countries, not the use of
force by other parties to compel the
United States to settle a dispute peaceably
which our people might be unwilling to
arbitrate or submit to a Council of conciliation.
We might be willing for instance,
to combine with other nations to
use force against a weak power, but I
doubt whether we would be willing to use
force against a nation such as Germany
over the Servian question, and I feel sure
that we would be unwilling to allow foreign
nations a right to use force against us.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>THE MILITARIST</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY</div>
    <div>JOHN EDWARD OSTER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>A militarist is a blind,
heartless, soulless, murderous,
irrational being. He is
not a man. He is a savage
either in heart or manners or
both, and is not even a brute, for a brute
kills only in self-defense, or for the want of
food. He has the feelings, thoughts and
inclinations creditable to the worst beast,
but not to civilized man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without the slightest doubt, the lowest
occupation that a man can have is to be a
militarist, and it matters not if it is his
vocation, avocation, or, whether he is
merely an abettor, accessory or accomplice.
When he becomes active he is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>soldier and then he can no longer distinguish
right from wrong, and as far as
humanity is concerned, he ceases to think,
and is not allowed to reason under any
circumstances, and his only alternative is
obedience to the commands of his
superior, or he is shot with less compunction
than a stray dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncompromising obedience is the first
law of militarism, consequently, he obeys
without hesitation when ordered to fire on
his fellow citizens, on his nearest friends,
on his fond children, on his aged parents,
or even on his beloved wife. When he is
ordered to fire down a crowded thoroughfare
where poor non-combatants and emaciated
victims of military rule are clamoring
for bread, he instantly obeys and
sees the wrinkles of old age filled with gore,
and the gray hair of fathers and mothers
stained with red blood, and streams of
life blood gushing from the mangled
breasts of helpless women, feeling neither
pity nor compunction of conscience.</p>

<p class='c008'>The militarist is responsible either
directly or indirectly for the state of mind
which causes these cruelties. The mind
is so calloused by the spirit of inhumanity
which the militarist fosters, and by the
atrocities which according to his reasoning
he rightfully practices, that without
giving a thought, he will, when appointed
as a member of a firing squad to execute
an illustrious hero or public benefactor,
shoot him down without hesitation, although
knowing that the bullet kills one of
the noblest men who ever lived on earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The militarist thinks in terms of bloodshed,
and measures everything in terms of
force, hence, his encouragement of the use
and application of murderous machinery
and methods by the nations of the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The militarist is responsible for the existence
of the soldier, whose mind, conscience,
life, and very soul are in the
keeping of his officers, for all that was
human in him, all that was religious in
him, and everything that constitutes the
distinctive qualities of manhood was
sworn away when he took the oath of enlistment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mind of the militarist is bounded
on the North by Blood, on the East by
Envy and Hate, on the South by Sorrow,
Horrors and Distress, and on the West by
Demolition, Destruction, Devastation and
Gore.</p>

<p class='c008'>The militaristic mind travels in a trench
by stage coach, lives in a cave, reads
ancient tomes by candle light, thinks of
the enemy skulking about, and fears that
an antagonist is lurking in every nook and
corner, and that behind every tree and
fence foes are lying in ambush. It is
blind to everything that has happened
since the dawn of civilization, and is
seemingly ignorant of the results of progress
and of almost every matter of common
knowledge regarding civilized conditions
of life. It requires proof of what
every mind knows—that we are not bloodthirsty
cannibalistic enemies—and in
spite of that construes plain English
language and International Law to mean
something entirely different from what
Webster ever imagined or any other mind
would deem possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Be it remembered, however, that while
the Militaristic Mind lives under the conditions
before stated, the Militaristic
Personage uses electricity, the telephone,
telegraph, aeroplane, the Palatial Hotel,
long range telescopes, high explosives,
rapid firers, and all other modern conveniences
and luxuries produced by
civilization, which the Militaristic Mind
ignores—the owner of the Militaristic
Mind being entirely distinct from the
Mind itself, and quite fully aware of
changed conditions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Militaristic Mind is unable to see
anything but fighting, which in reality is
wholesale murder, but as he sees it, it is
merely right being packed up by might, as
was believed in the dark uncivilized days
when wild tribes first banded together for
purposes of massacre on a larger and more
effective scale. It teetotally objects to
change in the settling of disputes between
nations, and still wishes to annihilate the
enemy who has the unbridled audacity to
disagree, and still wishes to continue
smashing and cutting the enemy to pieces
rather than recognize civilized methods of
settling international misunderstandings,
methods in harmony with the times.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>To the Militaristic Mind the idea that
life is more sacred than property is the
most abhorrent possible. The Militaristic
Mind, however, has great merits and
shows great possibilities when occasionally
it breaks from its fetters, and would
be a very excellent sort of mind if it was
only humane as well as inhuman; but
being the latter apparently prevents it
from being the former. But there is hope
for the Militaristic Mind. It has been
getting so many shocks and severe jolts in
the past few months that a fissure must
soon appear in it through which common
sense and the ideas of modern civilization
will penetrate and seep in, and in time
undermine its rock-ribbed precedents and
prejudices.</p>

<p class='c008'>Freed from the smoke, rust, and cobwebs
which now enmesh it everybody
will admire and respect it, instead of
being, as nearly everybody is now, irritated
by it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everything considered, no man can fall
lower in the scale of humanity than a militarist—it
is a depth beneath which we
cannot go, for the greatest thing in the
world is man, and the greatest thing in
man is mind, therefore, one who concocts
and schemes to destroy ruthlessly and
wantonly, the greatest thing in the world,
is the worst enemy the world contains,
and the rock bottom of the depth has been
reached by this arch murderer.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no such thing as being neutral
in this regard. Every individual is either
a militarist, or he is opposed to it. When
the sheep are separated from the goats,
one camp or the other will be supported by
an extra member, and that extra member
is you, therefore be sure and be counted on
the right side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having to choose between the two alternatives
of safety and war, or in other
words between peace, good will and hell,
strange to say, some choose the worst,
which seems incredible and leads one to
think them helplessly hopeless. The time
is at hand for the population of the world
to recognize the fallacy of force and the
perniciousness of that abominable, detestable
doctrine, by inaugurating conciliatory
methods appropriate to the
present standard of civilization.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c012'>A PEACE SUGGESTION<br> <span class='large'>IN A WARLIKE GUISE—AN EFFECTIVE POLICY OF NAVAL DEFENSE FOR THE UNITED STATES AT A MINIMUM COST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c002'>Samuel Lake, who is called the
father of the “even-keel submarine,”
a device the use of
which has given the German submarines
such terrible efficiency, gives some interesting
views of the future of this terror
of the seas in an interview published in a
prominent daily paper. We have all seen
during the past year how mechanical and
chemical invention has added to the
horrors of war. The query most vital to
the future of peace is as to whether the
further development and perfection of
such devices will not make war so horrible
that it will be impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Lake is the head of a great submarine
shipyard at Bridgeport, Conn.,
and speaks with the authority of an
expert.</p>

<p class='c008'>He expresses his firm belief that when
the submarine is fully recognized and
when the governments of the great
nations fully prepare themselves for
defense and offense with such craft,
“there and then naval war will cease!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Submarine preparedness will not end
marine warfare merely by making it
horrible, for horrors do not deter men
from belligerency, but by making successful
operations by other naval vessels impossible.
Mr. Lake thinks that Germany
has been moved to keep her fleet locked up
in safe harbors more by fear of the allied
submarines than by fear of the allied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>dreadnoughts. It is to be noted that the
Allies have not made such effective use of
submarines in this war as the Germans
have, but this is not because the Allies are
not equipped with these under water craft.
They have, in the aggregate, more than
Germany has, but they have had few
German sea-going craft to operate on.
The German merchant marine was swept
from the seas at the very outset of hostilities,
and the German fighting craft, except
the submarines, have been kept safely
hidden.</p>

<p class='c008'>Applying his theory to the elucidation
of a proper defensive policy for the United
States, Mr. Lake says: “The United
States can make itself so strong that it will
be practically beyond attack by providing
itself with a sufficient number of submarines
of a defensive type.” In this
view the creation of a big submarine navy
by this country would not be a policy
of aggression, for the submarines can not
be effectively used to attack shore
defenses or to land armies abroad, but it
would be simply a provision of prudence
to guard our own shores from hostile
fleets and hostile armies.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fleet of submarines, provided with
sufficient freeboard and buoyancy to
permit themselves to ride at anchor comfortably
in all weathers, fitted with submarine
signals, searchlights, sound-receiving
apparatus and wireless, if there
were enough of them to form a cordon
about the city or harbor to be defended,
could not, in Mr. Lake’s opinion, be
beaten.</p>

<p class='c008'>He estimates the number needed for the
effective defense of our east and west
coasts at one hundred and fifty, the cost of
which would not be more than the cost of
five super-dreadnoughts. He also believes
that the speed of the submarines
can be developed to 25 knots an hour,
which is the maximum speed of the larger
and heavier craft of the great navies.
This would enable them to surround the
big battleships coming near our coast,
and in many cases to pursue them farther
out to sea. The smaller ones could be
shipped by rail if it should be found necessary
to quickly concentrate a fleet of
under sea boats at any particular point on
sea coast or lake or river. These smaller
submarines Mr. Lake calls amphibious
boats, and they would be in addition to
the large submarine craft stationed in or
near the harbors. In a comprehensive
statement of the general merits of this
plan of national defense, the inventor
says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“The moment a hostile fleet appeared near
any port, submarines could be rushed to that
port in such numbers as were deemed necessary—and
they would ‘get’ the hostile fleet. No
doubt about it.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Really, for coast defense, such a fleet of
submarines could be more speedily mobilized
than the fastest fleet of battle cruisers and
super dreadnoughts.</p>

<p class='c020'>“If an attack threatened Charlestown, submarines
could proceed by rail from New York
at thirty-five miles an hour, in certain safety.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Delivery of such boats as I refer to could
begin within nine months, and three or four a
month could be delivered thereafter, using
only existing facilities.</p>

<p class='c020'>“We have plenty of shops which could turn
out the gasoline engines they would need.
Diesel oil engines are superior for a boat can be
run twice as far on a given quantity at one-fifth
the cost, and the heavy oil used in Diesel
engines is non-explosive, but the disadvantages
of gasoline could be largely overcome by
carrying the fluid in tanks outside the boat.
Thus a supply for 500 miles of cruising could be
carried without danger.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I believe this suggestion for the provision
of amphibious submarines to be the most important
suggestion for the defense of the
United States which has been made in many
years. It offers the quickest, the most
effective, and the least expensive defense so far
imaginable.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Our capacity for turning out craft of this
type would be enormous.</p>

<p class='c020'>“All lake and ocean yards could build the
hulls, all the automobile and boat engine
building plants could build engines for them,
and there are several electric appliance and
storage battery plants that could build the
electrical equipment.</p>

<p class='c020'>“To my mind, the day is close at hand when
the only safe place for a battleship will be an
interned pond closely protected against land
attack.</p>

<p class='c020'>“And let us consider the cost of maintaining
such a defensive fleet in time of peace, comparing
it to the cost of the conventional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>modern naval fleet. To man a submarine of
the coast defense type will require twenty men,
while the amphibious submarines which I have
suggested can be manned by crews of ten men
each.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Say we had fifty of the amphibious boats.
That would require a total of 500 men.
Estimate the force necessary to man the coast
defense type at 3,000 men. Thus, less than
4,000 men would give us a perfect defense for
every harbor in America, and, I think, could
prevent any invading force from landing elsewhere
on our shores.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The system would be immensely superior
to our present coast defense system, each fort
or group of forts of which defends only a small
radius of territory immediately adjacent
thereto. This submarine defense, through its
mobility, would defend not only our harbors,
but every inch of our shore line.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ECONOMIC WORTH OF WAR ORDERS</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>A banker pointed out recently
that too much stress might be
laid on the fact that the extra
business being done by arms and ammunition
making concerns is of a temporary
sort. The profits entailed, he said,
would not prove to be simply an unexpected
inflow of cash to be distributed
to stockholders and considered merely as
a gift of fortune. The extraordinary
earnings would be used in part to strengthen
the position of many companies for
the future, funded debts in the way of
long term issues as well as temporary
loans would be liquidated and working
capital sufficient for increased manufacturing
needs would be laid aside.
Knowledge of this far-reaching value of
war orders, the banker thought, was receiving
more consideration from thoughtful
investors than the desire for big extra
dividends.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>PAUPERISM DECREASING</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Pauperism is decreasing in the
United States, according to the
latest statement issued by the
U. S. Census Bureau. “The ratio of
almshouse paupers has steadily declined
at every census since 1880,” declares the
bureau’s last bulletin. In detail, the
bureau reports that one third of the
paupers in the almshouses in 1910 were
under fifty-five years of age and one
third over seventy years of age; the males
outnumbered the females two to one, and
there was a preponderance of persons of
foreign birth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The important fact brought out, however,
is that the almshouse population is
not only actually decreasing but is also
steadily assuming a more shifting character,
which means that the poor-houses
are becoming merely a temporary shelter
instead of a permanent home for the unfortunates
who are compelled to take
advantage of their hospitality.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE TENANT FARMER</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The Socialists are working overtime
in an effort to frighten the
people with their tales about the
tenant farmer. They point out that the
tenant farmers have increased much faster
than homeowning farmers, there being
about 8 per cent. of the latter as
against about 16 per cent. of the former.
Recently the United States government
made an investigation into the condition
of the tenant farmer in the three
states of Indiana, Illinois and Iowa and
from this we find that the average size
of farms managed by tenants for the
three states is 172 acres; that the average
income of each farm is $1,732, and the
average expense $740, leaving for the
average tenant farmer an income of $992
a year.</p>

<p class='c019'>Samuel Gompers, President of the
American Federation of Labor, in a
letter recently made public, declared his
abhorrence of war, but at the same time
his belief that there are some things more
abhorrent than war. One of these things
would be to be robbed of the birthright
of freedom, justice, safety and character.
“Against any attempt of any person
or group of persons, or nation or
nations, to undermine or destroy these
fundamentals of normal human existence
and development,” he adds, “I would
not only fight to defeat it, but would try
to prevail upon every red-blooded liberty
and humanity loving man to resist to the
last degree.”</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>President Kilpatrick, of the School Garden
Association of America, in an address
at Labor Temple in New York, deprecated
the general disposition to educate all
children to live in the city. “It is time,”
he said, “we should educate them so that
they will have an opportunity to make a
choice if they wish to do so.” To this
end he would encourage classes in rural
and household economics, and give the
advantages of country living a fair show.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>The trade balance of the United States
for the current year seems likely to exceed
a billion dollars. This is due to unusually
large exports of food stuffs at high prices,
and to exports of war supplies and munitions.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>This year’s crops in the United States
give promise of unusual abundance. The
estimate is for 950,000,000 bushels of
wheat, 1,300,000,000 of oats, and about
three billion bushels of corn. There
will probably be some reduction in the
cotton crop because of the substitution
of food crops for cotton in most of the
cotton states. A smaller cotton crop will
naturally mean better prices for that
staple. So on the whole the outlook for
continued prosperity in the United States
is good if this country remains at peace.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>If the Mexican people possessed intelligence
and courage enough to demand
and enforce the cessation of murderous
activities by their bandit leaders, that
country might now enjoy great material
prosperity, for it is rich in things which
the world is paying high prices for. It
has copper, rubber, and petroleum, as well
as gold and silver, and a soil that could be
made to produce abundant food crops.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>The recently issued Summer Social
Register of 1915 shows a reduction of
75 per cent. in foreign residences or banking
addresses abroad of Americans. This
indicates the effect of the war on society
in restricting foreign travel from this
country. A Wall Street note also indicates
that many notable financiers and
captains of industry are taking their summer
vacations in visits to the Pacific
Coast and other portions of their own
country instead of the usual European
visit. The tourist agencies have also
changed their activities to promoting
“seeing America first.”</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>Some time ago Prof. Kuno Meyer predicted
that the present war, instead of
being quickly ended, would develop into
a world-wide war, in which America
would try to remain neutral, but would
ultimately have to fight to protect her
own interests. Let us hope that Prof.
Meyer is too pessimistic. Already there
are some significant signs that peace may
not be so far off as some people suppose.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>Miss Angela Morgan, one of the American
delegates to the International Women’s
Conference at The Hague, says that German
college professors whose names are
well known in the United States told her
that they were opposed to the annexation
of Belgium or any other foreign territory.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The old Latin motto to learn from the
enemy might be applied with advantage
(to themselves) by the British nation
whose eminent leaders are complaining
of slack work in the manufacture of munitions
of war. A neutral correspondent
of a London paper, returning from Germany
says the workmen in German ammunition
factories put in fifteen to twenty
hours’ continuous work at a shift; that
they never strike and never go on a vacation.
Every worker works with the
utmost diligence and energy of which he
is capable, because he knows that if he
slacks he will be sent to the front and
placed on the firing line. This is war.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>The American <cite>Army and Navy Journal</cite>
thinks that militarism will not be dead
no matter who wins in the great war.
It prophesies that when the conflict does
end “everything points to a continuance
of the military systems as they existed
before the war, strengthened and expanded
in accordance with the lessons learned
from the conflict now raging.” The only
thing that can save the world from such a
calamity is the establishment of a World
Court for Judicial Settlement by the agreement
of the majority of the great nations.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>Speaking of the talk of war with Germany
over the <i>Lusitania</i> tragedy, Cryus
Northrop, President of the Minnesota
Peace Society, and President Emeritus
of the Minnesota University, said in an
address to the students: “It is easy to
talk of drastic measures, but what could
we do in the event of war? Could we
send our Navy over there? Where are
the 48 British Dreadnaughts? We cannot
suppose any different treatment would
be accorded our fleet if we went over
there. And could we send our army over
there to be killed under ground? The
idea is preposterous.”</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>The most prominent person who has
called ex-Secretary Bryan a traitor is
Colonel Henry Watterson, the most distinguished
Democratic Editor in the
country. He said in his paper, the Louisville
<cite>Courier Journal</cite>, under the caption,
“Treachery Unspeakable.” “The President’s
note (to Germany) contains nothing
which should jostle the Imperial sensibilities,
but the actions and utterances
of Mr. Bryan cannot be so dismissed.
Men have been shot and beheaded, even
hanged, drawn and quartered, for treason
less heinous. The recent Secretary of
State commits not merely treason to the
country at a critical moment, but treachery
to his party and its official head.”</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>H. G. Wells, the famous British author,
in a recent letter to the London <cite>Times</cite>,
severely criticised his government for
lack of efficiency in carrying on the war.
He says: “Throughout almost the entire
range of our belligerent activities we
are conservative, imitative and amateurish,
when victory can fall only to the
most vigorous employment of the best
scientific of all conceivable needs and
material. Unless our politicians can
perform the crowning service of organizing
science in war more thoroughly, I
do not see any great hope of a really glorious
and satisfactory triumph for us in
this monstrous struggle.”</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts,
in an address at the Commencement
Exercises of Union College, said
it would be as futile to abolish armaments
as it would be to abolish knives because
knives often inflict wounds. The reason
of war, in his opinion, lies far deeper than
armaments—it is the desire to use armaments
wrongly for aggression. A general
reduction of armaments should be sought
with earnestness, “but for one nation to
disarm and leave itself defenseless in an
armed world is a direct incentive and
an invitation to war.”</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c008'>Governor McCreary of Kentucky is a
believer in peace, but, unlike William
Jennings Bryan, a believer in peace with
honor. He is quoted as saying recently:
“If the flag of the United States is insulted
on land or sea I am ready for war,
and in the event of war I shall exercise
my prerogative as Commander in Chief
of Kentucky troops and go to the front.”</p>
